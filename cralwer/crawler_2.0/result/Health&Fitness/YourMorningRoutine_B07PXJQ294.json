So we focused on the most common areas, back, knees, hips, elbow, ankles/feet, shoulders, and sciatica.\n\nEach problematic area has four exercises to follow, and the entire routine will only take 20 minutes out of your day. If you find you have more than one area, then it will take you 20 minutes for each program you follow.\n\nThis is our first Alexa Skill, and we want you to be a part of making this even better; if you find something that is needing to be changed please let us know. The more we know the better our skill can help you.\n\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
