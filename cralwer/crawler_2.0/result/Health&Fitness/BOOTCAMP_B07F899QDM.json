Each 30-minute session, the skill provides a range of exercises for fitness beginner to expert. \nThe skill can be use with or without equipment. Alexa will ask if you have dumbbells, a kettle bell, an exercise ball (Swiss ball, stability ball) or a medicine ball. If you do, extra exercises are added to the range for each piece of equipment. \nOnce setup, Alexa will then select random exercises from the range which you perform for 30 seconds. You then get a short rest while Alexa randomly selects the next exercise. Every workout session is different so you won\u2019t get bored.\nNot sure how to perform an exercise, ask for help and Alexa will give you instructions. You will also receive a picture card on your device.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
