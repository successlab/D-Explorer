In fact, you could save up to $1,500 by choosing an alternative.* First, call your primary care provider (PCP) or family doctor. Many doctors offer same-day appointments, but if that's not possible, you may be able to receive fast, professional care for much less at an urgent care center, convenience care clinic or an online doctor visit. With our new tool, we will quickly help you find the right option that fits your specific need.\n\nNote: Check your official health plan documents to see what services and providers are covered by your health plan. Suggested care options are not medical advice. If you believe you are having an emergency, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
