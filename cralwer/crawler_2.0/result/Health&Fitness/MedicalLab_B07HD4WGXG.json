This Alexa skill will help you both interpret the abbreviations of medical lab tests and also further your understanding of why the lab test may have been ordered. For example, if you ask \u201cWhat does LDL mean?\u201d, you will learn that \u201cLDL or low-density lipoprotein is a type of cholesterol associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, and is often called the bad cholesterol\u201d. The skill will provide a basic understanding of the test, but does not provide medical advice or specific diagnoses.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
