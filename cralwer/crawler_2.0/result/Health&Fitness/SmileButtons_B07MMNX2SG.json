It's the little things that can count. Hold a door open for someone. Tell a funny joke.\n\nThat's what Smile Buttons is about. Behind each button that we share is something small: a video, an audio clip.\n\nIt's not grandiose, but we hope they'll put a smile on your face, and hopefully, inspire you to share them and put a smile on others. We hope you enjoy!\n\nWebsite: https://smile-buttons.herokuapp.com/about\n\nTo learn more about my other skills, check out my website here:\n\nhttps://alexa-skill-dev.gitlab.io/alexaWebsite/", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
