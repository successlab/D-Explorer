It uses two well-known clinical screening tools known as the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 in order to make its determination of severity, and provides valuable resources for additional information should it deem necessary.\n\nYou can choose to do a \"quick\" or \"full\" checkup, which dictates how many questions you will be asked. If this is your first time using the app, you should begin with a full checkup. For optimal results, please try to complete a \"quick\" checkup every month with Wellness Guru.\n\nThis service is not meant as a substitute for medical care, and is intended to serve as an educational tool to help start a conversation about mental health with your doctor. Additional information on anxiety and depression can be found at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (adaa.org). \n\nAdditional resources:\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness: www.nami.org\nNYC Well Helpline (for anonymous counseling): 1-888-NYC-WELL\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nV1.1 (10/14/2017): Added functionality to track user's previous checkup responses and sends a card of resources/responses to user's Alexa app\nV1.0: Added functionality to assess for both anxiety and depression", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
