Once the skill is activated, it will guide users through their morning, reminding them to accomplish regular, daily tasks, as well as complete other tasks that are intended to boost their mood. By the end of the task, the user will be left with some activities to be completed later on in the day for the purpose of not having a completely unplanned day. The goal of this skill is for the user to be feeling better by the end of the day so that they can resume normal responsibilities by the following morning. By creating the voice of a Mental Health Manager that balances a somewhat authoritative tone with comedic relief, the user will be prompted with a morning schedule while being occasionally met with unexpected humor. This voice reminds users that taking a mental health day can be very useful and, even at times, fun. This skill is not intended by any means to cure depression, and is also not a guarantee to help users feel better or less depressed. This skill was also not created by licensed psychotherapists, psychiatrists, or doctors of any kind. If at any point while using the skill the user starts to feel suicidal, 911 should be called immediately and this cannot be done through this Alexa skill.\n\nThis skill was built with love by VoiceApps.com.
