Then, you can let me know you've taken that medication. You can ask me what your medications are and I will let you know the ones you haven't taken today (within the past 24 hours) and what times they should be taken, along with a list of the ones you have taken and the hours that have passed since. Please ensure you check your own clock as well to ensure you are being completely safe with your medications (also see disclaimer at the bottom). My calculations are based on when you last took your medication, and the server timezone. You can also remove medications if you no longer need them.\n\nAlso, when you ask me what all of your medications are, I will write them down as a home card. To see it, open the alexa app and navigate to home.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n- What are my medications\n- Add pain medication for 4 pm\n- I've taken my pain medication for 4 pm\n- Have I taken my pain medication for 4 pm?\n- Remove pain medication for 4 pm\n\nIf you say \"Alexa, open medicine tracker\" I will also remind you of what I can do.\n\nDisclaimer: This tool does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
