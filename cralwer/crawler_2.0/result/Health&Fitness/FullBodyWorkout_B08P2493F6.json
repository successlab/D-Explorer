Working out results in having more energy, feeling happier, being more self-confident and in many more physical and mental benefits.\n\nThe most frequent feeling you get, however, during your training is \u201clike you\u2019re going to die.\u201d Chances are that this is not going to happen and that you actually have a lot more energy to keep exercising. Realistically measuring how long you can go on depends on several factors such as heart rate, muscle fatigue, hunger, intensity. \n\nA quality workout doesn\u2019t have to be long at all despite what your ultimate goal is. Building muscle of losing weight is obtainable with 20-minute workouts as opposed to an hour at the gym (who has so much free time anyway\u2026). Maintaining your weight doesn\u2019t need a lot more than half an hour of brisk walk every day and eating right.\n\nHave fun with this full body workout!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
