I'm a Clinical Hypnotist with more than 25 years of experience in private practice, including eight years with the UK National Health Service. I have treated thousands of people from all over the world, for a wide range of physiological and psychological issues, from Acne to Zoophobia.\n \nTherapeutic hypnotism is best done in person, when your specific circumstances can be accommodated. I have recorded some hypnotherapy protocols that you can experience with this Alexa skill in your home, in case personal therapy isn\u2019t possible.\n \nThis is not a substitute for mainstream medical care. If you have pressing problems, please consult your physician. While you are waiting for your appointment my hypnotherapies will not do you any harm, and have done many people much good. There are no pills, no scalpels, and no trawling through your past; just a quiet communication between my subconscious mind and yours to help you feel better about yourself, and better within yourself.\n \nI offer six full, free therapies in this skill. You can enjoy unlimited access to all my 70+ therapies with a monthly subscription or purchase a bundle of ten hypnotherapy sessions of your choice.
