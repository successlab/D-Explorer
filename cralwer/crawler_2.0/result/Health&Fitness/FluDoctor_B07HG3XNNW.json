She will help answer your questions about the flu shot, different types of flu vaccine, and the influenza virus and its consequences. You can ask questions about the vaccine, who should get it, where you can get a flu shot, how well it works, vaccine ingredients, and how to protect yourself and family from influenza virus and the complications that can develop from the infection. We\u2019ll give updates throughout the flu season about flu activity, how well the vaccine is protecting people, and additional ways for you to protect yourself, your children, and your community.
