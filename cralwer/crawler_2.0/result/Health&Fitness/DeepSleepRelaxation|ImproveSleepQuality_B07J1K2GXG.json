The mind-calming practice can be done at bedtime or any time during the day to help fight fatigue & insomnia.\n\n\"Deep Sleep Relaxation\" helps you learn how to let go of the stresses of the day. Think of it like exercising a muscle that gets stronger over time. This allows you to tap into that same ready relaxation state when it\u2019s time to say goodnight.\n\nIn fact, \"BDeep Sleep Relaxation\", the practice of intentionally quieting or focusing the mind, creates physiological changes that are similar to those that happen in your body during the early phases of sleep. Your pulse slows, blood pressure drops, and stress hormones decrease. Being able to get to that state on demand means that you\u2019ll have an easier time drifting off when you want to. Bedtime Meditation helps you overcome insomnia, reduce stress and improve sleep quality. Fall asleep more easily.\n\nNote: This skill does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purpose only and is not substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
