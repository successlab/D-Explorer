The workouts range from beginner to intermediate level and can be completed at home with no equipment. Each workout is progressive, so if you are new to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), start with workout 1 and work your way up. The workouts are in real-time, so you can train together with Joe and follow his instructions.\n\nTo get started, just say \u2018Start The Body Coach\u2019. As a returning user, you can easily access your last completed workout. Alternatively, you can choose another one of the 7 workouts. Every HIIT session is different and will get you working muscles all over your body, so if you find your favourite workout, you can jump right in by saying \u2018Ask The Body Coach for workout 5\u2019 for example.\n\nGrab a bottle of water, get warmed up and get exercising with The Body Coach!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
