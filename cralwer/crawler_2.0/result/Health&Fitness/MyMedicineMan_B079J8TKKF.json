Say \"Alexa, ask My Medicine Man\", it will tell you if you have any reminder pending. If there is one when you check, you know it\u2019s time to take your meds. \n\nAfter you have taken your meds, just tell Alexa to \"cancel now\" or \"I got it\" to remove the reminder. CareRinger will know not to call to remind you this time.\n\nLet CareRinger schedule your daily reminder for you, or use the Amazon routine to program your daily routine yourself. To schedule a reminder call, just say \"Alexa, ask my medicine man to set a reminder for 2 hours\" or \"remind me in 30 minutes\". CareRinger will call to remind you, and let your trusted contact know if the call is not answered. For more information about customizing your routine, please refer to the Amazon documentation.\n\nHalf the people in the U.S. do not take their meds properly. According to Dr. B. Chan, my nephew: \"Most of us have difficulty starting new medications, particularly those requiring taking them at certain times of day or multiple times per day - this requires developing new habits and routines.\" The \"My Medicine Man\" skill simply helps you build these habits to improve your health. \n\nTo begin, you need to register for the CareRinger service.
