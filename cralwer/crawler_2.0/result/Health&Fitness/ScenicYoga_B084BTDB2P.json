We imagine a world where everybody has on-demand access to a professional yoga instructor so that each person can learn this discipline at his/her/their own pace. We take the yoga teaching outside of the studio and into scenic locales all across the great state of Hawaii so that screen-enabled Alexa can follow the yoga movement while enjoying the scenic beauty of our beautiful island. Practitioners can use their voice to say \"Alexa pause\", then \"Alexa continue\" when ready. With screen-enabled touch devices, users can scroll and select the video and yoga topic they want to watch. Prior to starting the video, Alexa will also let the user know what the next yoga pose or sequence to call up or select. Audio-only devices are able to say \"Alexa, play next\" to hear the next pose or sequence.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
