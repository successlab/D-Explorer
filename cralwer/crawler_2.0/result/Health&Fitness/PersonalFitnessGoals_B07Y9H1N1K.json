No two people are alike and I really want to encourage you to set personal fitness goals based on your own unique and totally personal fitness level. What seems easy to your best friend, significant other, children, parents, colleagues, or strangers on the internet is NOT necessarily easy for you. You get to choose what you want to accomplish and your goals don\u2019t have to take anyone else into account. They have to be YOUR goals. They have to mean something to YOU. You will never feel the win unless the success means something to you, at the core of your being. Don\u2019t worry about what other people are trying to achieve. Ignore the media and the news and what your jealous cousin Sue is telling you. Define your own wins. And then go out and start winning.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
