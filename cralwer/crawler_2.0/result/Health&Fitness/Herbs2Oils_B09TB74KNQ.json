Ever feel like you get lost in the crowd - or perhaps you have a part to sing, but there are so many other altos in the choir that you feel your voice will not make a difference. - I used to feel that way. But I have learned that our parts, our voices, our skillsets, our unique personalities are critical in the orchestra called life. This world needs YOU. - That said, with all the anxious feelings flowing around us, just how are we supposed to cope, let alone contribute... I offer practical education, encouragement, and hope. We primarily discuss essential oils and many other modalities for mental health and well-being. The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
