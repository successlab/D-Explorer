A standard \"tabata\" consists of eight rounds, each with twenty seconds of \"work\" and ten seconds of \"rest\". During the \"work\" portion of each round, you perform an exercise of your choice, like push-ups or sit-ups, at high intensity. During the \"rest\" portion of each round, you rest. Your goal is to perform the greatest number of repetitions in each round that you can safely maintain for all eight rounds. Tabata training has been demonstrated to be more effective at improving fitness than long duration, moderate intensity exercise.\n\nSergeant Tabata tells you when to work and when to rest. It supports standard tabatas and also custom tabatas with your choice of work time, rest time, and number of rounds.\n\nThis skill is not sponsored or endorsed by SIMPLETOUCH LLC.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
