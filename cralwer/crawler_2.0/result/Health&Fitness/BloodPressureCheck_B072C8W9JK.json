This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: blood pressure check", "reviewnum": " 13", "des": "High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a risk factor for heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. Controlling high blood pressure has been shown to decrease those risk factors. It has been estimated that 1 out of every 3 people in the United States over 20 years of age has high blood pressure, and 1 out of 6 of them do not know they have it. \n\nBlood Pressure Check simplifies the process of understanding what your blood pressure (BP) readings mean compared to targets recommended by the American Heart Association. It takes into consideration whether you have heart disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease or not, in order to use the appropriate recommended goals. You simply tell Blood Pressure Check your blood pressure reading and whether you already have any of these conditions, and it tells you how your BP readings compare with the appropriate recommended targets.\n\nThe information you provide to get an analysis of a blood pressure is neither stored in any database nor shared with anyone.

In addition, it can help those unaware that they have hypertension realize that they indeed have it so they can get treatment from their physician to decrease their risks.\n\nThe blood pressure targets for Blood Pressure Check are based on guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as published in November 2017.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
