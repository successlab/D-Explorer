You're all registered. Now that Alexa-enabled device is linked to that specific care receiver. If at any point you would like to unlink the device, click on the \"Edit Device\" button and then the \"Delete Device\" button.\n\nOnce the device is linked, the care recipient can use voice commands to open and interact with Independa on their TV, and also retrieve relevant information from the Independa system. Below is a list of commands to help them get started.\n\nTo open Independa on the TV, say \"Alexa, open Independa\". The microphone will remain open for about four seconds, and you can give subsequent commands without having to say \"Alexa, ask Independa to...\".\n\nTo close Independa and go back to watching TV, say \"close Independa\" or \"watch TV\".\n\nTo hear a generalized help menu, say \"open the help menu\".\n\nTo get help with a specific feature from the help menu, say \"help me with <feature name>\". For example, saying \"help me with navigation\" will give detailed instructions on how to use voice commands to navigate Independa on the TV.\n\nTo hear events from the care recipient's community calendar, say \"what events can I do\". This will default to events in the next two hours, but you can request activities within a certain time period by saying \"what events can I do between <start time> and <end time>\", for example, \"what events can I do between 7pm and 8:30pm\". Be sure to use \"am\" or \"pm\" with both times.\n\nTo hear events from the care recipient's personal calendar, say \"what's on my calendar\".\n\nTo enter health readings, say \"enter my weight\" or \"enter my pulse\", which will prompt you for your weight in pounds or pulse in beats per minute, respectively. To enter a reading directly without the prompt, you can say \"enter 150 pounds as my weight\".\n\nTo initiate a video chat with a person from the care receiver's contact list on Independa, say \"start a video chat with <contact name>\". Alternatively, you can say \"start a video chat\" to go to the list of contacts on the TV, and use \"left/right/select\" to select a contact from the list and initiate a call.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
