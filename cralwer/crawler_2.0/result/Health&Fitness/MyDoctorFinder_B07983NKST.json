When enabling this skill, a user must provide permissions for MyDoctorFinder to access the postal code of the Alexa device location and ensure that the Settings section of the companion Alexa phone all has the zip code populated. The skill does not require access to the full address information. The invocation phrase is \"doc finder\" and after launch a help is available. A typical example is \"find a gynecologist near me\" which will provide name, phone number and practice address of up to three gynecologists, sorted by distance, from the location. When pronouncing the specialist type, please speak slowly and distinctly, as some words sound similar - such as neurologist and urologist. When Doc Finder cannot match requested specialization with doctors, it will provide names of closest internal medicine professionals. The skill can help locate such medical providers when in need. The accuracy of any information is provided on a best efforts basis only and is not a medical advice or referral.
