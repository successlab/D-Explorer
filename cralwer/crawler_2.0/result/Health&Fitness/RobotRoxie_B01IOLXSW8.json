Here are different features.\n\nTo begin, say \"Start Game\" and a new game will be initialized. By default, the games are three innings long, and each player gets ten swings.\n\nYou can customize the player names by saying \"Change Player One/Two name to <name>\".\n\nSay pitch ball and Roxie will track that a pitch was thrown. Let Roxie know what happened next - either say \"Strike, Ball, or Base Hit\" and it will track the score.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
