Contrary to most peoples understanding about chiropractic, the focus is not on the spine and bones, Chiropractics focus is on the nervous system. It just happens that the spine is the part of the body that irritates the nervous system. thus, reducing the ability of the body to work effectively.\n\nIn chiropractic care, the body is adjusted. The adjustments target the body and nervous system and not the condition. \n\nAt Purity Chiropractic we specialize in upper cervical chiropractic. Upper cervical chiropractic is a specific method of care that a lot of people seek due to it being a very gentle technique with no cracking of the neck yet extremely powerful at relieving the irritation to the nervous system. \n\nChiropractic care gives no definite time of healing as it relies on the body\u2019s natural time and ability to heal.
