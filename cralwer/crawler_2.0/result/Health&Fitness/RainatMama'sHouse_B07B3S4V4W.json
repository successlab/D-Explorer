Just say YES following the welcome prompt and the rain will begin.\n\nOne day my mama sent me a video of the rain in her backyard. It sounded amazing. So I called her and walked her through how to record audio on her phone using the Voice Memos app. Explaining this took about 20 minutes. Once she got it working, I asked her to leave her phone on the back porch for a while. And then I made this skill so you all could hear it too.\n\nSure there are lots of rain sound skills. But this is my mama's rain.\n\nSkill Icon from The Noun Project (by Chameleon Design)", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
