First of all, it can be really fun to learn about something so random as smoking. \nAnd second, if you are a smoker that could be reason enough. As smokers, we pick and choose how we view cigarettes, it\u2019s very personal. And so even if quitting crosses our minds, we don\u2019t have nice, fuzzy feelings about it. It\u2019s hard and very personal.\n\nThe facts aren\u2019t meant to scare you. They are a mixed bag of the good, the bad and the neutral. This way you have the chance to slowly gain a bigger perspective about it all; to slowly, easily, subtly, maybe change the way you view smoking. \n\nIf at some point you start noticing yourself looking at cigarettes differently, then that could be a good thing, right? Maybe you will even find yourself at some point considering quitting sooner rather than later; or not; that\u2019s ok too. It\u2019s actually a chance to learn about this habit as you start your day.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
