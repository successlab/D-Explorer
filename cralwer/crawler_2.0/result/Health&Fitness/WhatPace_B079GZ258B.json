Try the following:\n\nUser: Alexa, ask What Pace to calculate pace.\nWhat Pace: Please specify distance.\nUser: marathon.\nWhat Pace: Please specify total duration.\nUser: 4 hours.\nWhat Pace: Running a marathon in 4 hours requires a pace of 9 minutes and 9 seconds per mile.\n\nIf you invoke What Pace with just the invocation phrase, it will begin by asking you to specify if you want to calculate pace or time and continue as in the example above.\n\nUser: Alexa, open What Pace.\nWhat Pace: Begin by saying: calculate pace, or, calculate time.\nUser:Calculate pace.\nWhat Pace: Please specify distance.\nUser: 10 kilometers.\nWhat Pace: Please specify total duration.\nUser: 45 minutes.\nWhat Pace: Running 10 kilometers in 45 minutes requires a pace of 7 minutes and 14 seconds per mile.\n\nDistances can be specified in miles, or kilometers. To make things easier, some popular run distances are recognized: \"marathon\", \"half marathon\".\n\nDuring the interactive mode of What Pace, you can say \"Help\" to hear information and examples on how to specify the proper input. You can also say \"Stop\" to exit the skill.\n\nAt this time, the only pace unit supported is minutes per mile.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
