It not only provides supportive feedback when you log your weight, but tracks exercise, both aerobic and strength training, and gives you coaching messages on exercise or healthy eating whenever you wish. The healthy eating coaching is matched to the time of day in your time zone. In other words, if you ask for healthy eating coaching in the morning, the message will be appropriate for breakfast or a morning snack.\n\nTo get started just take these two steps:\n1. Register your name\n2. Create your Weight Loss Plan by giving your starting weight, starting date, goal weight, goal date and time zone. The time zone allows healthy eating coaching to be coordinated with your time of day. So, for example, tips in the morning focus on breakfast or morning snacking.\n\nOnce you have registered and created a Weight Loss Plan, you can:\n\u2022 Log your weight. My Weight Loss Coach will log your weight and give you feedback on how you are doing compared to your last weigh-in.\n\u2022 Log your exercise, either aerobic or strength training.\n\u2022 Ask for coaching on healthy eating or exercise whenever you need it.\n\u2022 Ask for a progress report any time along the way.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
