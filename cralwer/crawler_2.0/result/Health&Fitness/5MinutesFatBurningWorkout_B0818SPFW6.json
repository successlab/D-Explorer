It engages all the abdominal muscles, reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and strengthens the muscles on the side of the abdomen, which are usually very difficult to get. The bicycle crunches exercise works out your upper, middle and lowers abs all at the same time. Crisscross is quite a challenging exercise, as it trains your entire core. It strengthens your abs and lower back.
