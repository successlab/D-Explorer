Weight Loss Wizard ensures you are on the right track by calibrating your real-time calorie intake, versus your actual weight loss. And not just weight loss, this application ensures you are losing fat, not muscle by gathering full body measurements. Weight Loss Wizard also allows you to manually enter you own body fat percentages to get the most accuracy. Once a week, you will have an official weigh-in. You must keep track of your calorie intake during the week for this application to be accurate. Weight Loss Wizard will analyze your goal with your actual weight loss, taking into account your calorie intake and your body fat difference. Weight loss wizard will give you a full analysis of how your weigh-in went, giving you the exact percent of calorie changes you should make in your diet to meet your goal. If you are not dedicated to losing weight, this advanced application is not for you. Please find a more basic application. You can view measurements on the website ActualCalorie.com on convenient charts and graphs and also edit and print your calorie logs. You can optionally calibrate a fitness tracker, see documentation below.\n\nDocumentation (Weight Loss Weight Version 1.0)\n\n-Step 1. Launch the application and give your basic information such as name, timezone, birthday, and gender.\n-Step 2. Give all of your measurements including height, neck, waist, and thighs for females. (Please note, you must give all of your measurements anytime you log.)\n-Step 3. Tell Weight Loss Wizard your goal of how many pounds you want to lose per week, how active you are, and when you want to start your weight loss program.\n-Step 4. Your first official weigh-in is on the start date you set! Please make sure to weigh-in and get your measurements in the morning before eating. During your first official weigh-in, you will be asked if you have a fitness tracker, if you would like to calibrate a fitness tracker, say yes to this prompt.\n-Step 5. Wait one week and count your calories during this time (you will need them for calibration).\n-Step 6. Your weekly official weigh-in will ask you for your measurements, and calorie intake. Weight Loss Wizard will run an analysis of how your weight loss is going and give you feedback. The application will set your new start date as that day, and the week starts over again.\n-Step 7: View results at ActualCalorie.com\n\nFitness Tracker Calibration: To calibrate a fitness tracker you have two options.\nOption A - Tell Weight Loss Wizard how much you burned during the day previous by say \" log calories burned.\" You must log the prior day's calories, and obviously you would not do this on your start date. \nOption B- During your official weekly weigh-in, you can give Weight Loss Wizard your entire weekly burn by adding up the numbers yourself. You will be prompted for this number if you did not log your calories burned for each day of the week.\nTo disable fitness tracker calibration say, \"disable fitness tracker\"\n\nHelp & Support\nOnce your account is set-up, you can use these features.\n\"log food apple\" (where apple can be any food)\n\"log my measurements\" (you must give every measurement including height)\n\"reset my goal\" (you will set a new weight loss goal and start date)\n\"reset my account\" (all of your data will be reset and lost)\n\"enable fitness tracker\" (calibrate a fitness tracker with your weight loss, you must have an official start date set)\n\"disable fitness tracker\" \n\"how many calories\" (total calories logged)\n\nHelp, Support & Feedback\n-If there are issues or bugs with the skill, contact us at Support@ActualCalorie.com\n\nDisclaimer: This skill is for entertainment purposes only.
