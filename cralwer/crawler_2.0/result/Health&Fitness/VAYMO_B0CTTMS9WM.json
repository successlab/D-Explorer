The skill administers a variety of mood questionnaires and guides users through the process of setting daily and weekly goals as part of the depression management process.\n\nCaretakers may also interact with the users through a study-provided web dashboard that provides summaries of the user's goal progress and feedback on what did and did not work. Caretakers may also record \"words of encouragement\" that can be played back by the skill to give the user some additional encouragement and support for completing their weekly goals.\n\nThis skill is only available to study participants that have ALREADY been screened and enrolled in the research study.\n\nThis study has been approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board: IRB no.
