Call your doctor to receive medical advice. If you think you may have a medical emergency, please dial your local emergency response phone number.\n\nWhat is Wellness Check?\nWellness Check is a voice decision-tree with yes-no questions to help people learn what to look for in symptoms. Symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose a medical disorder, but can be useful as \"clues\" to possible underlying conditions. Knowing what to look for in symptoms is an important life skill for people to make an informed decision in time of need. Today, there is a wealth of information for general public in printed and online sources on how to identify clues to symptoms. However, literacy and accessibility issues in healthcare have been preventing such knowledge to be accessible by many, especially at the time when they need it. \n\nWellness Check helps solving the problem by using Amazon Alexa. With a few yes-no questions, Wellness Check brings out possible signs for a wellness condition, and offers the user a compelling reason to talk to a doctor. A quick access via voice empowers people to make an informed decision to make use of professional services effectively.\n\nThree design guidelines dictate what Wellness Check does and doesn\u2019t.\n1. No medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment shall be provided by Wellness Check.\n2. No personally identifiable information shall be used or collected by Wellness Check.\n3. Wellness Check shall only use general public information for accuracy and integrity of the content.\n\nTo meet the three design guidelines, the decision trees are adopted from the cited reference for medical accuracy, and the textual content is completely revised for safe, anonymous access to educational information.\nReference: The American Medical Association Guide to Your Family's Symptoms, Eds. C.B. Clayman & R.H. Curry. Random House, New York, 1992.\n\nHow does Wellness Check work?\n1. Invoke this app by \"Alexa, open wellness check\", or \"Alexa, ask wellness check for . . .\u201d with a few words that describe a symptom, for example, \u201cAlexa, ask wellness check for coughing\".\n2. Wellness Check is a decision tree application. It asks a few yes-no questions until it reaches the end. User simply answers each question by saying, yes or no.\n3. When the decision tree reaches the end, it tells user to seek medical help with a brief description of clues and conditions, if any. Once done, user can try different symptoms by speaking symptom words.\n4. At any time, user can terminate the app by saying \u201cAlexa, stop\u201d, or simply \u201cstop\u201d when the app is done speaking.\n\nWellness Check recognizes over 60 symptoms at the initial release, and more will be added in later releases. See the list of symptoms below.\nFeeling under the weather\nFeeling tired\nLoss of weight\nOverweight\nSleep problem\nFever\nExcessive sweating\nItching\nLumps and swellings\nFaintness and fainting\nHeadache\nDizziness\nNumbness or tingling\nTwitching and trembling\nPain in the face\nForgetfulness and confusion\nDifficulty speaking\nDisturbing thoughts and feelings\nDepression\nAnxiety\nHair and scalp problems\nNail problems\nGeneral skin problems\nSpots and rashes\nRaised spots or lumps on the skin\nRash with fever\nPainful or irritated eye\nDisturbed or impaired vision\nEarache\nNoises in the ear\nDeafness\nRunny nose\nSore throat\nHoarseness or loss of voice\nWheezing\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing\nToothache\nDifficulty swallowing\nSore mouth or tongue\nVomiting\nRecurrent vomiting\nAbdominal pain\nRecurrent abdominal pain\nSwollen abdomen\nExcess gas\nDiarrhea\nConstipation\nAbnormal-looking bowel movements\nAnal problems\nGeneral urinary problems\nPalpitations\nChest pain\nBack pain\nPainful or stiff neck\nPainful arm\nPainful leg\nFoot problems\nPainful or swollen joints\nPainful knee", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
