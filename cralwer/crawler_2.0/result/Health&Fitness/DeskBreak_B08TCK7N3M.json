With desk jobs and working from home becoming a more permanent solution to the\npandemic, it is more important than ever for us to be mindful of how much time we spend in a seated\nposition.\nSitting all day long can lead to health problems such as lower back pain, neck pain, and hip and pelvic floor issues. It also has been shown to be a contributing factor to mortality.\nDeveloped and designed by Dr. Shannon Connolly to combat the lower back pain and pelvic floor issues she sees every day in her practice.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
