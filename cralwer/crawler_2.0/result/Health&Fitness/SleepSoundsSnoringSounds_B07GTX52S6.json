This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: snoring sounds", "reviewnum": " 13", "des": "Snoring Sounds simulates your friend or partner (or maybe your pet!) sleeping nearby and gently snoring away in rhythmic, soothing slumber.\n\nYou can say:\n\n\"Alexa, start snoring sounds\"\n\"Alexa, play snoring sounds\"\n\"Alexa, launch snoring sounds\"\n\nThe skill plays an ambient sound track featuring someone (Alexa or Alex?) in a sleep so deep and relaxing, that they are gently snoring away, right beside you. The track lasts several minutes, after which it will loop. It's comforting to know that if you wake in the night, you'll have Alexa's gentle snoring for company. Just use the device's wake word and say Stop or Pause to end the session. \n\nSnoring Sounds can:\n- help you relax and get to sleep, especially if you normally have company but tonight you're home alone\n- make your home seem cosier and bring some comfort, when you're the only one at home\n- make people *think* you're in, when you're really out. (Use this super-power wisely!)\n- trick a friend into thinking you're in your room, when you're hiding in a wardrobe (hey, it takes all sorts!)\n- when played on two or more devices at different volumes, give the impression of a whole family at home\n\nPlease leave a review in the Alexa app if you enjoy Snoring Sounds.
