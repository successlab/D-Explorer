That feature requires you to first register with a first name before assessing your cognition abilities. After that, you can rate yourself in the following areas on a scale of 1 to 5:\n1. Sharpness\n2. Memory\n3. Speed\n4. Keeping track of what you are doing despite interruptions\n5. Concentration, and\n6. Clarity\n\nYou are given an opportunity to log your scores so you can compare them in the future. Those comparisons can be between your first and most recent scores or between your most recent and previous scores. Brain Aware does not give medical advice. If you have concerns about your scores or the trend of them, you should discuss them with your physician.\n\nAn added feature is the ability to schedule reminders for you to check your scores on a periodic basis.\n\nBrain Aware uses the PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 \u2013 Cognitive Function \u2013 Abilities Subset to enable the user to ask themselves six questions about their perceptions of their thinking abilities.
