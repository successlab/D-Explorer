When SteamLinx is installed, MrSteam residential steam shower systems are compatible with Alexa-enabled devices. Whether you\u2019re on the road home, relaxing in your living room or just waking up, your MrSteam SteamShower will be ready when you are. To use the skill, click enable above and sign in with your SteamLinx account to link to your MrSteam SteamShower System. You must have SteamLinx installed and connected to your steam generator and your home router. Note: Only one MrSteam system can be linked at a time. You will be prompted to select a MrSteam system if you have more than one associated with your SteamLinx account. If you have more than one, you will need to alternate between them by disabling the skill and re-enabling/linking it to one of the other spas. If the steps above did not work, verify that the correct account/skill/MrSteam system were used/selected. If they were, disable the skill and try linking it again.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
