Olympic Trainer turns your Alexa into that someone-else. You'll be surprised just how enjoyable it is to have her by your side!\n\nYou can choose from 3 very unique trainer personalities, all of whom will have you moving in no time, with fun and sometime hilarious motivational comments:\n - your Cheerleader is very bubbly\n - your Friend is kind and encouraging\n - your Drill Sargent is downright demanding\n\nThe basic version of this skill allow you to use the basic system exercise routine. The premium version allows you to immediately design your own custom workout routines, using your own voice.

Olympic Trainer will automatically move you up to new levels as you progress. If you want to jump ahead, just say Go to Level, then a number between 1 and 10.
