We offer transparency and the opportunity for patients to truly understand what they are getting out of their healthcare plan.\n \nOne aspect of this is direct primary care (DPC) providers. These providers focus on telling patients up front what the cost of any service may be. They also provide additional quality time and a better experience with patients.\n \nAnother aspect is the smart agents and advisors that are able to find health insurance plans depending on the needs of the patient. Whether this is a catastrophic plan or full coverage, our agents and advisors will find the best plan for the patient. \nThe last aspect is the advocacy service. This service is here so the patient is able to have someone on their side. They will help find the best prices and services for each patient and make sure that the patient is getting the best quality care. \n\nPlease contact us at advocates@cuw.edu or (262)-243-2246 if you have any questions or concerns!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
