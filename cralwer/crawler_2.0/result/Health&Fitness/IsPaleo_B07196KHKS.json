To use the skill say \"Alexa ask Is Paleo if I can have bananas\" or you can say \"Alexa open Is Paleo\" followed by a question like \"Is garlic Paleo?\". Alexa will then let you know if your item is or is not allowed on the paleo diet. \n\nSome items have special responses. If she doesn't know she will also let you know. After asking a question you can either ask another or say stop to end.\n\nIs Paleo has over 700 food and ingredient items and is continuously adding more. If you would like to contribute to the list by recommending a food(s)/ingredient(s) to be added or have general feedback then please shoot me an email at paleofeedback@gmail.com. \n\nI will update the list as quickly as I can to ensure our paleo community has a plethora of items to ask about.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
