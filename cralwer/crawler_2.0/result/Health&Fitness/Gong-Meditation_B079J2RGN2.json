A short break from the stressful everyday life can be a helping and strengthening experience for everyone. For your gong-meditation session you can freely choose a length that fits your needs and time constraints. Customizable intermediate gongs give you clues as to how much time has passed on the journey into yourself.\n\nThis way, you can tailor the meditation session for you individually: For example, you could start a 15-minute session with a gong every 5 minutes. The session starts with the first gong. In the next 5 minutes, you could do some breathing exercises first. After the 5-minute gong, you follow up with some stretching exercises. After the 10-minute gong, your quiet meditation phase could follow, in which you try to clear your head. The session ends after 15 minutes with two consecutive gong tones. By now, you feel refreshed and strengthened.\n\nOf course, you can split your meditation session in a completely different way. The skill adapts to your wishes.\n\nDo you have questions or suggestions? Write us to hello@dave42.com!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
