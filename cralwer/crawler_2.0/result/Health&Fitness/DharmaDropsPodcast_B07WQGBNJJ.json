This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Listen to the first few minutes of Dharma Drops Podcast and get in on the yoga, life, whatever shenanigans. Dharma Drops is a little bit about yoga, a little bit about life, and a little bit about whatever. Dharma Drops was born out of resistance to the norms, standards, and dogmas that often permeate the current yoga culture. It is a conversational podcast that explores topics both related and unrelated to yoga. At the heart of the podcast, we honor the teachings and lineage of yoga. But we also recognize that there is no singular way to be a yogi and that there is more to life than just yoga alone. I should also add that it has an explicit content rating because sometimes I'm a little bit of a potty mouth. And, remember, these are musings not Truths.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
