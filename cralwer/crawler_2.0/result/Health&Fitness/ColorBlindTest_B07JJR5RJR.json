Within the pattern are dots which form a number or shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, and invisible, or difficult to see, to those with a red-green color vision defect. Other plates are intentionally designed to reveal numbers only to those with a red/green color vision deficiency and be invisible to those with normal red/green color vision. \n\n This skill require an Amazon device with display like Amazon Echo Show.\n\nNotes:\n\n Notes:\n Plate 1 and 24 are control tests \u2013 people with normal vision and all forms of color blindness should be able to distinguish these. These two plates are particularly useful for identifying cheeky behavior when testing children!\n This test cannot guarantee complete accuracy. Alexa Devices are not medical devices. The monitor and quality loss of online images may affect the original colors used.
