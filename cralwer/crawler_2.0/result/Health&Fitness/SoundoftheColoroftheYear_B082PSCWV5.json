The sound of PANTONE 19-4052 Classic Blue is built on the timelessness and enduring nature of PANTONE 19-4052 Classic Blue, as our hearts call for a nostalgic song that takes us to a place of comfort and familiarity. The Sound of the Color of the Year utilizes traditional instruments treated in innovative ways, bridging the gap between past and present.\n\nThis skill contains the exclusive release of the ambient music that premiered at the reveal event at ARTECHOUSE NYC. \n\nTo jump right into an audio experience, say, \"Alexa, ask Sound of the Color of the Year to play the Event Music\" for a looping ambiance.\n\nIf you have any questions about the experience, please email info@auxnyc.com or visit www.auxnyc.com/pantone2020 for more details on the project.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
