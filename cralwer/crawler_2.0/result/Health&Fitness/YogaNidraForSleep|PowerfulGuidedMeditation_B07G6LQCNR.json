Yoga Nidra ... is a practice that everyone, from children to seniors, can do.\nYoga Nidra is a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping, like the \"going-to-sleep\" stage. It is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions.\n\nYoga Nidra is an accessible meditation practice that focuses on cultivating multiple levels of well-being. Practiced with consistency and awareness, you may likely discover that you can find a good amount of peace in a short period of time. It offers a space to explore what you need at the moment, as well as an opportunity to work on releasing long-held emotions.\n\nNote: This skill does not provide medical advice, is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
