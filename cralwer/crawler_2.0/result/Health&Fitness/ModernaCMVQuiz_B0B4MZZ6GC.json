Viruses are a natural part of our day-to-day lives. While the immune system gets rid of most viruses in days to weeks, some of them stay inside us our entire lives. These viruses are called \"latent.\" Usually, they hide quietly without causing symptoms. But when they come out of hiding, or reactivate, latent viruses can cause transient illness or long-term disease. For instance, did you know that CMV is the most common infectious cause of birth defects? At any time, you can say \"Alexa, next\" to move to the next question or \"Alexa, stop\" to exit the quiz.
