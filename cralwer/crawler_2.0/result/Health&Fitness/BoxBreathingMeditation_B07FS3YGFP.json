It became even more popular over the past years due to numerous podcasts and talks, especially because it's been used and propagated by Navy Seals.\n\nSome benefits on health and well-being:\n- Calm down\n- Reduce stress\n- Improve mood\n- Lower blood pressure\n- Treat insomnia\n- Treat panic and anxiety\n- Cope with pain\n\nDon't use this skill to replace professional medical treatment. Please go see a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms!\n\nThis skill allows you to do up to fourty rounds at a time. One round takes about 16 seconds, so four rounds take about one minute.\n\nIt is recommended to meditate for 5 minutes per day (about 20 rounds). In addition to that, you can meditate with more shorter cycles over the day as you see need to improve focus and mindfulness or want to reduce stress. Try to sit in an upright position when starting the meditation. The benefits of this skill: You can focus on breathing entirely while listening to the instructions - no need to monitor a stopwatch or a phone and count seconds yourself.\n\nI initially wrote this skill for my wife, she wanted to wind down entirely and didn't like watching her phone while meditating. I'm now offering it to a broader audience, so if you have any feedback or feature requests, please let me know: boxbreathing@gmail.com", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
