Often the expiry date is lost while taking out tablets\nfrom the packets, which leads to doubt while going for the medicine again. It can, at times, make us dispose medicines which are not expired or consume the expired ones.\n\nThe app takes on a revolutionary way to help prevent these problems by remembering the name of the medicines along with their expiry date.\nThis functionality will add the following abilities to the Alexa environment:\n\n1) Adding a medicine name along with its expiry\n2) Removing a medicine\n3) Listing all the available medicines\n4) Retrieving the expiry date for a particular medicine\n\nBy providing such easy to use features, the 'medicure r. x.' system aims to empower and help the patients in taking conscious steps towards their well-being.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
