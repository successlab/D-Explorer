This makes the user physically fit, as well as increases the user's knowledge base.\n\nNOTE:\n\"The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.\"\n\nHere are the things you can say once you initialize the skill.\n\nRepeat/Say Again - To hear the question again\nHelp - To get detailed instructions\n\nGood luck!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
