They are also becoming more important for many of the diets where blood sugar levels play a part.\n\nSugar Daddy does only one thing and does it fast - tell you the GI and GL for many common foods. Pulling information from a list of close to 800 food items, you can learn some surprising information about how the foods you eat affect your blood sugar levels.\n\nSugar Daddy is designed to locate the GI/GL of core foods and not compound elements. You can lookup spaghetti, eggs, bacon and cheese, but you cannot lookup Spaghetti Carbonara as there are too many recipe variations of this tasty dish making the results inaccurate. (Hint: Use Lentil pasta if you are concerned with your blood sugar levels!)\n\nSugar Daddy will do what it can to try to find your item or attempt to determine what you were asking for when it can't find the item directly. If it cannot do so, it will log your request so that the author can update the database as soon as possible.\n\nImportant: Sugar Daddy is not intended as medical information or to replace the advice or information provided from your medical practitioner. The numbers provided are taken from many different public sources and are only as accurate as those published sources. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of transcribing these numbers, errors may occur and will be corrected when detected.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
