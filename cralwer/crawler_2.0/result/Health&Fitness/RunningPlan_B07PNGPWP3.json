Whether you are looking to run 5 km, 10 km, half marathon or a marathon, Running plan got you covered. Simply configure the skill with the distance you want to complete and the deadline or race date. Then, Running plan will keep that in mind and you can ask him every day what is your running plan. The plans offered ranged from 3 to 4 days per week and aim at increasing your performance by doing intervals at different speeds.\nYou think it might be too hard and would like to take it easy? Then add the 8 weeks warmup program to slowly ramp up and be best prepared for your upcoming challenge.\nTo start your journey, simply ask \"open running plan\", the skill will guide you through the configuration. Once it is done, you simply need to ask every day what is your running plan by saying \"open running plan\" or \"ask running plan\". The skill will tell you what to do and you can go. Go at your pace and don't overtrain. The intervals are there to increase your cardio and enable you to run longer by training less.\nOnce you get it, the training days are always the same during the week. But because we are in a world of many constraints, you can ask running plan for the next or previous workout if you can't make one session.\n\nPlease leave a review if you find this skill useful and most of all efficient. I would really appreciate that and it will motivate me to build more features or other skills for the community. I take every feedback because it is the best way to make the skill great for everybody.
