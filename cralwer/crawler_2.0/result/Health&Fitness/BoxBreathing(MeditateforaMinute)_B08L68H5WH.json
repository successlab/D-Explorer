This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: box breathing", "reviewnum": " 83", "des": "Alexa will take you through a short breathing exercise known as four square breathing (box breathing). It will get your breathing into a Rhythm and reduce stress. Alexa will finish with an affirmation for your day and will ask if you want her to play relaxing music. Alexa will continue to play music for 3 minutes if you say yes. The skill is a great way to start your day.\n\nThe skill is optimised for screens and has an animation to help with the breathing. It also includes relaxing background images.\n\nThe skill is great for beginners who want to try and make meditation a routine. I highly recommend adding the skill to a routine.\n\nTo create a Routine in the Alexa app on your mobile device: Go to the menu and select Routines. Select the + icon in the top right corner. Select When This Happens, and then choose how to trigger the Routine. Then select Add action and Select Skills and then select your skills and find this skill from the list of skills you have enabled.\n\nThis skill is also great for people who just want to get ready to meditate with a breathing exercise. In the future Guided meditations may get added.\n\nThank you for trying my skill.\n\nHugo\n\nFeedback:\nhttps://hugo.fm/contact\n\nHUGO.FM", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
