As your mind wonders from image to image slowly, you will gradually find yourself getting sleepier and sleepier until you fall asleep. The program works best when you lay down to sleep, call out to Alexa to open Sleep Aid, relax, and visualize the scenes silently in your sleeping position. The volume should be adjusted to be loud enough you can hear the scenarios, but not so loud it will keep you awake. The idea is to fall asleep to the sounds. The scenes are randomly provided to you and Alexa will stop after about 10 minutes.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
