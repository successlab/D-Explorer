This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: memory span", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "This skill provides the classic 'memory span' test to measure your working memory capacity. It works by saying sequences that you have to remember and repeat back, increasing the sequence length to see the most you can do. After testing this 'forward span', you then are tested on 'backward span' which is a harder test where you have to say the sequence backwards. This accesses memory differently and tests different working memory components.\n\nThe full test takes about 7-8 minutes to complete. During that time, Alexa will ignore requests to repeat, so pay attention!\n\nIn this version of the test, you can use sequences of digits, letters, names, or colors. In memory research, the most common form is the 'digit span' test, which is used as part of many tests of cognition and IQ. Although researchers generally use a traditional '2-step' version of the test, this version defaults to a 'stairstep' version for greater precision as described by Wood et. al 2011.\n\nYou can change the type of test by saying, \"use the 2 step protocol\" or \"use the stairstep protocol\".
