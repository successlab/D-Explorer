This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: push up mastery", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Welcome to Push-Up Mastery! This skill was designed to teach you every key detail from the ground up.\n\nThe push-up is one of three pinnacle exercises for building strength (Pull-ups/Squats are the other two). These workouts will take you from a complete beginner, all the way to professional athlete!\n\nWhat's Included: \n--------------------\nWorkouts - There are 9 workouts across 3 difficulties (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). Alexa will coach you through each workout, explaining how to perform each exercise, and giving cues to help you learn/improve. \n\nHigh-Level Training - These workouts were designed by a personal trainer with years of experience teaching movement-based exercise. They are designed to fit a program (3 workouts/week) that will yield serious results.\n\nVideos - For devices with a screen, there are videos for each workout available. There are videos breaking down each exercise as well (more below).\n\nMusic - You can set your music setting (no music, up beat, or calm) and Alexa will play music during your workouts.\n\nFeatures - Pause workouts, restart workouts, ask for specific workouts, change music/difficulty settings.\n\n\n---------SKILL RESOURCES----------\nVIDEOS:\n - To access a video for a specific workout, you can say \"Play video for beginner workout 3\"\n - To see a breakdown of every exercise, you can say \"Play the movement breakdown video\"\n - To see a friendly message from the developer, say \"Play video from the developer\"\n\nWORKOUTS\n - NO EQUIPMENT NEEDED\n - There are 3 workouts per difficulty.\n - Complete all three workouts every week, and then repeat. \n - Beginner workouts are 15-25 minutes. Intermediate = 30-40 minutes and Advanced = 40-50 minutes.\n - During a workout, you are no longer in the skill. Because of this you can only pause, resume, and restart a workout once it has started (and adjust the volume) \n - To access other features once a workout has started, reopen the skill (\"Open Push Up Mastery)\n\nWHAT TO SAY:\n - \"Start my next workout\"\n - \"Play beginner workout 2\"\n - \"Restart my previous workout\"\n - \"Change music\" (\"to calm\")\n - \"Change difficulty\" (\"to advanced\"\n - \"Play the video for this workout\" (When asked if you are ready to start your next workout)\n - \"Play the movement breakdown video\" (Plays a video teaching each exercise for your current difficulty)\n - \"Restart (only during a workout)\" \n - \"Play the video for intermediate workout 3\" (Only if you have a device with a screen)\n\n\n\n-------FROM THE DEVELOPER-------\nWhat's up guys? Thank you so much for taking time to check this skill! My name is Petey, I'm a personal trainer/Alexa Developer.
