This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: sleep stories", "reviewnum": " 9", "des": "Sleep Stories provides exclusive relaxing audio stories to lull you to sleep. We loved having bedtime stories read to us as children so why should that stop now that we\u2019re all grown up? Sleep Stories is a timeless collection of relaxing readings from voice artists around the world. The creators and collaborators of Sleep Stories personally suffered from lack of quality sleep and the negative effects it has. Suffering from sleepless nights does not have to be your reality. Instead, try using a variety of techniques including Sleep Stories on Alexa.\n\n61% of Americans fall asleep with the TV on while also soaking in blue light from the screens. This negatively impacts the quality of your sleep by suppressing production of melatonin (the hormone that keeps your sleep/wake cycle in check), and it can delay sleep onset. Use the screen-free, soothing audio from Sleep Stories to avoid blue light and drown out the thoughts bombarding your racing mind. The effect is similar to a white noise machine - the ambient noise can help decrease the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. Plus, listening to a Sleep Story that you are familiar with can offer a sense of familiarity and comfort.\n\nAn optional premium subscription is available, which unlocks the full story catalog adding many new stories read by our professional voice actors.\n\nWith the help of our audience, we will continue to improve the Sleep Story experience and grow the library of content. Please use the comments and reviews section to provide feedback and content requests for future releases. If you are interested in reading for Sleep Stories, please contact us directly.\n\nEach story will play until the end and you may skip through stories until you find one you like.\n\nWe hope you'll love Sleep Stories and give us a rating. If you feel that Sleep Stories needs improvement, please let us know at support@sleepstori.es and we'll do everything in our power to make it better.\n\n* The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
