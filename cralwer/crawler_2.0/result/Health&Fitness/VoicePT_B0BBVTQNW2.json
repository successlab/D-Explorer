Introducing VoicePT.\n\nVoicePT is a free, voice-first software system that increases home exercise program adherence, which leads to better outcomes, faster recoveries, and has less chance for injury recurrence.\n\nVoice-activated physical therapy leaves your hands free to focus on the correct movements of each exercise instead of trying to awkwardly navigate paper images or even having to look at your phone.\n\nDoing physical therapy exercises is hard! Common pitfalls can include:\n- Keeping track of exercises: order, timing, and counting\n- Remembering how to do your exercises properly\n- Motivation to get through them\n- Feeling like you are left on your own to do them\n\nAs a result, only 35% of people complete their prescribed physical therapy exercises at home.\n\nVoicePT makes it easier!
