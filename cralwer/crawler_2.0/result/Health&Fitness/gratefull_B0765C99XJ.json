This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: grate full", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "Gratefulness is the act of expressing gratitude and being thankful for what you have. As research suggests, practicing gratefulness daily leads to a positive outlook on life, improving your physical and emotional health. Not only that, spending some time reflecting on your day and reminding yourself of the positive events can help you sleep longer and better!\n\nPracticing gratefulness with a notebook and pen requires additional effort in our already busy lives. This skill makes it quick and easy to build a powerful habit. Simply say: \"Alexa, start grate full.\" When asked, tell Alexa what you are grateful for and don't forget to rate your day on a scale between 0 and 10 (10 being the best). That's it - you are done! It takes less than 2 minutes. \n\nIf you need help during the process, simply say, \"Alexa Help\". If something came up and you can't finish, just say \"Alexa Stop\" or \"Alexa Cancel\". All the best!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
