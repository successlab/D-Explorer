The test consists of a series of Landolt rings (incomplete circles) and telling Alexa the location of each ring's opening. With this information, the Skill can estimate your quality of eyesight and whether you likely need glasses or whether your current eyeglass prescription has changed. \n\nWhen speaking the location of the ring openings, you can name the direction (top, left, right, bottom, bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right or top-left) or the cardinal point (north, south, west, east, north-west, north-east, south-west, south-east).\n\nNote: This skill does not guarantee accurate results and is not an alternative to a medical examination by a professional optician.\n\nThe test requires about 5 minutes of time and 2 meters (about 6.5 feet) between you and your Echo Show or Echo Spot.\n\nPlease take a moment to leave a review if you find Eye Exam useful, or send us feedback via e-mail to info@169labs.com.\n\nPictures by shutterstock.com\n\nThis skill does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
