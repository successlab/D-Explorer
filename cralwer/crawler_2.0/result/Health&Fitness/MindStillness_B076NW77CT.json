By learning how to filter out the continual, often pointless, what-if scenarios, and other, usually unfounded worries and fears that our conscious mind tends to throw at us during the time we are awake, it is possible to quieten our mind to the point where inner peace becomes an everyday reality. To be free of the incessant noise that the conscious mind creates, a noise which many people are not even aware of, is an amazing feeling. An enlightenment.\n\nNow, whether you follow a path that involves meditation already. Or whether you just want to learn how to be more relaxed and have a little more control over your mind, then there are a great many techniques that can help. And best of all - even a little progress in searching inwards can bring the immense benefits of mind stillness, a sense of peace where you put yourself back in touch with your real inner self. \n\nBut, if you are new to such things, how do you start? The Mind Stillness skill offers six short lessons that, if practiced regularly, will help you get back in touch with your inner self. The lessons are based on modifications of techniques that have been around for centuries. I have practiced these, and many other related techniques, for decades and know them to be effective. \n\nYou should initially perform these exercises in a quiet room with no distractions. Sit upright in a chair , lie on the floor, or even perform these exercises in bed if you prefer. All that matters is that you make yourself comfortable, \n\nAnd then say something like \u2018Alexa ask Mind Stillness to play lesson one\u2019, \u2018Alexa ask Mind Stillness to play lesson two\u2019 and so on. And, when Alexa asks what you want to do and perhaps you want to know more about a particular lesson, just say something like: 'Tell me more about lesson one'.\n\nYou can also ask for help, or ask for a meditation-related thought for the day. So, when Mind Stillness asks what you want to do, just say something like: 'I need something to think about'. Or, 'what is my thought for the day'. Or just, 'today's meditation'.\n\nThe order that you practice the actual meditation exercises is important. Practice lesson one first because that's an easy breathing exercise. Then move on to lesson two.\n\nLesson two offers, in addition, some visualization practice and most people will find this second lesson more difficult. Practice lesson two often and don't move on to lesson three until you feel that you are making progress.\n\nLesson three offers some interesting insights into how and why your mind continually labels things. It also gives some guidelines for reducing the mind's incessant labeling and this will provide a big step forward in quietening your mind.\n\nLesson four branches into the world of slightly more advanced breathing exercises. And lessons five and six provide further breathing and visualization training.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
