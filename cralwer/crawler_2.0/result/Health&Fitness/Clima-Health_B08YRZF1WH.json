In highly polluted areas one can wear a mask to protect from particulate matter like humanity did in the case of COVID19- a deadly virus. However, ozone is a gas and a silent killer, and the only solution is to reduce ozone pollution. We would like to create awareness through Alexa Voice Application Program on ozone pollution.
