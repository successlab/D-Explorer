Learn to relax, refocus and re-energise in just one minute with meditations. It is about becoming a powerful positive force in your own life. Many of us struggle to find even 1 minute of peace in our day, and this skill is for you.\n\nPracticing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time.\n\nFeeling frazzled ?? Nature can support you in settling down. The sounds of nature set a serene atmosphere for meditation, helping to quiet a busy mind and aid relaxation. You have to try it to believe it - just one moment of meditation can make a big difference.\n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a specific meditation or you can ask Alexa to select random. Each of these one-minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere is the list of the meditative soundtrack:\n\nTHUNDERSTORM\nAPPROACHING STORM\nSINGING BOWL\nBIRD CHIRPING\nWIND CHIMES\nRAIN\nFLOWING WATER\nMAGIC FOREST\nOCEAN WAVES\nRAINFOREST\nRELAXATION\nZEN STONES\nLULLABY\n\n***#***#***#***#***#***#***#***#***#***\n\nHope you like the skill and SOUNDMIX feature.
