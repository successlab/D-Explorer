It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis. Call your doctor to receive medical advice. If you think you may have a medical emergency, please dial your local emergency response phone number. \n\nIf you or someone in your household takes daily medications, you\u2019ll want to try My Medicine Chest. It gives you a way to keep track of those medicines, both prescribed and non-prescribed, and create a Medication List that you can easily share with your healthcare clinicians. \n\nAfter granting the requested permissions to work with lists and set reminders on your Alexa App, here are the simple steps to create your own Medication List and populate it with your medicines:\n1. Register as a user by saying, \u201cRegister me.\u201d You\u2019ll be asked to give a first name that will identify you afterward. Each member of your household can register and log their medications separately.\n2. Then say, \u201cAdd a medication,\u201d and My Medicine Chest will ask you for its name. This Skill uses a list of over 7,500 medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States to help recognize your medicine. Enter as many medications as you like.\n3. Next, you\u2019ll create your own custom Medication List, by telling My Medicine Chest, \u201cCreate a custom medication list.\u201d That list will then be accessible on your Alexa App on your smartphone. Each member of your household registered in My Medicine Chest can have their own personalized Medication List.\n4. Then, say \u201cAdd medicines to my Medication List,\u201d and you will be given a list of all the medicines you\u2019ve logged and told how to enter them into your Medication List either individually or all at once.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple! Now you can share your Medication List with the clinicians in your doctor\u2019s office, the Emergency Room, or wherever else needed. \n\nMy Medicine Chest has many other functions that you can hear in more detail just by saying, \u201cHelp\u201d once you have opened it on your Alexa/Echo Device. For instance, you can delete a user or medication, hear a list of your medications, and set a reminder. That reminder will help you make sure you keep your medication information up to date. To use it, just say, \"Set a reminder.\" For most functions, you can say, \"Repeat\" to hear what had been spoken again.\n\nA Few More Things To Mention\nYou should also be aware that if you delete a medication from My Medicine Chest, it won't be deleted from your custom Medication List on the Alexa App. To make those changes, you will need to do them on the Alexa App itself. You may also want to add more information to each of your medications on the Alexa App, such as the dosage strength and how you are taking it.\n\nAlso please note that any custom Medication List created will be visible to anyone sharing your Amazon Account ID. This is a great advantage in emergency situations where you may be incapacitated or cannot access your Alexa App. In such situations, others in your household would have access to your Medication List and be able to inform the clinical team of this important information.\n\nFinally, this Skill is in compliance with the USA\u2019s HIPAA regulations. Though your medication information gets stored in a database and is linked to your Amazon Account, we do not share this information with anyone. It is only used to provide the functionalities of My Medicine Chest. See the Privacy Policy URL for further details.\n\nSo, say goodbye to those crumpled, faded paper medicine lists that you keep in your wallet or purse, and try My Medicine Chest!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
