I was a stay at home mom, overweight, battling depression and totally lost. I didn't know where to turn, how to start, or what to do; but I finally woke up one morning and just started running. The running led to better eating habits, which led to a gym routine and more small steps along the way. I've had my ups and downs, but I am confident in my journey now, and ready to share some of my tips and struggles with you. Hopefully this will encourage you to join me in living a happier, healthier and more rewarding life by making small but consistent lifestyle changes. Let's have fun and stay healthy together!\n\n[ The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only. ]", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
