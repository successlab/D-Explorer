Be it a need to find comfort in boxed mac and cheese or noshing on gyoza, it's hard to stop a guilty pleasure from turning into a full on gorge of gluttony ! \n\nThis skill will help you to keep your sodium sins moderate. Optimum sodium intake is determined by age group and this skill will do the math to determine how much of a salty indulgence is roughly a third (or a meals worth) of target sodium levels for each age group. If you're in a hurry, you can just say something like \"tell sodium sins the box says two hundred milligrams per serving\".
