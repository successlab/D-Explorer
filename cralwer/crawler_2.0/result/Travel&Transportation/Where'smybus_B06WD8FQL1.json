You can add more than one if you need to.\n\nAfter that, say 'Alexa open my bus' and she'll tell you when your bus is coming. \n\nIf you want to remove a bus say 'Alexa open my bus and remove bus 10'.\n\nIf you want to list your buses say 'Alexa open my bus and list my buses'\n\nThis skill uses the 511.org service to get the departure times, but it's not affiliated with it, SFMTA or Muni.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
