This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: train times", "reviewnum": " 3", "des": "Ask this skill for the next train from a London Overground or Elizabeth line station, and we'll give you the next two trains for each destination. Your station is saved, after that just ask for 'next train'. The skill uses the live arrivals feed from TfL and will read them out the times.\n\nFor example, you can ask for \"next train from Hampstead Heath\". After that, just ask for the \"next train\" to get the Hampstead Heath arrivals again.\n\nThe coverage is for train services operated by TfL, which are London Overground or Elizabeth line trains. Trains from other operators in London aren't covered. The departure times are local to London.\n\nMore info about saved results:\n\u2022 The station you last asked for is saved\n\u2022 Ask for 'next train' and the saved information from the previous query is used\n\u2022 Ask to forget the station and the stored station will be cleared. Subsequent enquiries will then also ask for the station without saving it\n\u2022 Ask to reset the settings, and the original behaviour is restored\n\nFAQ\nQ. What stations are supported?\nA. Stations with London Overground or Elizabeth line services, in the UK.\n\nQ. Does this skill support national rail services?\nA. No, you will need to use another skill for those\n\nQ. Why isn't the station I'm asking for getting an answer?\nA. It probably doesn't have London Overground or Elizabeth line services. Alternatively, you might have another skill enabled which uses the same invocation of 'ask train times', and Alexa is sending your request to the wrong skill. You will need to check which skills you've enabled in the Alexa app.\n\nIf you're having difficulty using the skill, you can email me at techandsoftwareltd@outlook.com\n\nNotes about the data used: The arrivals data is supplied by TfL Open Data: \"Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2016 and Geomni UK Map data \u00a9 and database rights 2019.\"", "priv": ""}
