This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: belgian trains", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "This Alexa skill will get you information about train departures on the Belgian NMBS/SNCB network. Most of the skill flow is as such that Alexa will ask you the necessary information. When connecting for the first time, Alexa will ask for a departure & arrival station, and then fetches departure info about the next 5 trains. Arrival and departure stations are then set, but you can always change that by saying : I leave at {station} / I arrive at {station} (or even shorter : from {station} / to {station}). The skill also asks whether you want a direct (non-stop) connection or if any train connection will do.\n\nThis skill is based upon the iRail.be API, big shoutout to their work.\nThis skill is by no means affiliated by the SNCB/NMBS.", "priv": ""}
