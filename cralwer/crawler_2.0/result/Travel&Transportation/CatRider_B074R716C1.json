If you provide a shuttle and stop, but the shuttle is out of service or does not visit the provided stop, Cat Rider will inform you and instead provide arrival times for any other shuttles that are visiting that stop.\n\nOnce Cat Rider has enough information (a shuttle and a stop, or just a stop), it will make a query to TransLoc Public API, which uses real-time vehicle tracking to get precise arrival estimates.\n\nYou can also ask Cat Rider what shuttles are currently in service to get a list of all running shuttles.\n\nContact:\nAdam Barson - adam.barson@gmail.com", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
