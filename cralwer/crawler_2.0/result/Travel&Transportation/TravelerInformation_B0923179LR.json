Ever need to know what the road conditions are like for your commute to work or for your travel during the winter months? With the Traveler Information skill, you can find out about current road conditions, helping you prepare for road trips or for your commute to the office.\n \nStaying informed about road conditions is particularly important during interstate travel, since each state reports their road conditions independently. The Traveler Information skill takes the headache out of finding and identifying road conditions so you can focus on the road ahead.\n \nYou can say\u2026\n- \u201cAlexa, ask Traveler Information about the roads to Cheyenne.\u201d\n- \u201cAlexa, open Traveler Information \u2026 How are the roads between Laramie and Cheyenne?\u201d\n- \u201cAlexa, ask Traveler Information if the roads to Cheyenne are open.\u201d\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nThe Traveler Information skill uses the Situation Data Exchange (SDX) to identify the conditions along the roadways you\u2019re planning to travel. During interstate travel, drivers need to consult many different 511 services, road condition reports and maps to understand what they can expect on the roads ahead. The SDX removes this headache as it\u2019s a one-stop shop for critical, authenticated traveler information. The SDX supports messages covering roadways for all 50 states in a single, convenient service.\n \nWHAT STATES ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED?\nAs Departments of Transportation continue to adopt the SDX to relay road condition information to drivers, the Traveler Information skill\u2019s list of supported states continues to grow. During our beta period, the Traveler Information skill supports reporting conditions along Wyoming roadways exclusively.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
