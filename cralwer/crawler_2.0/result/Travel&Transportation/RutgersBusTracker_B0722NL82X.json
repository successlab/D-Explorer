The skill can be used to know the schedule of different buses between different stops inside New Brunswick campus. Invoke the skill by using the phrase 'Direct Tracker'. Request schedule by saying something like 'Get next bus from {source stop name} to {destination stop name}'. For example, you could say 'Get next bus from Stadium to Science Building'. The skill will return a list of buses between the requested stops ordered by their time of arrival. The skill is most effective with two-step invocation instead of one-shot invocation. The two-step process is the one explained above - open the skill first and then request schedules once you hear the welcome message. The one-shot invocation is something like \"Alexa, ask Direct Tracker to get next bus from Stadium to Science Building\". Please note that Alexa's voice to text translation is going to be less accurate for one-shot invocations.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
