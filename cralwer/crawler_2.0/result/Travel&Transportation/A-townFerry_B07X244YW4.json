Local merchants can know that an increase in traffic will be coming through town soon. \n 2. Residents can determine their automobile travel plans, avoiding Oakes Avenue congestion from ferry traffic.\n\nWe all know that our beloved ferries are delayed and swapped from the published seasonal schedules. What makes this skill unique is that it sources from WSF VesselWatch, which is much more timely and relevant than schedules.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
