This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: when is my train", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "When's My Train deals with 400 London Underground and DLR stations only. This has been a point of frustration for many reviewers who seem to have given poor reviews because we do not do overground stations. If you do have a problem with a station which is an Underground station then please tell us the name of that station in the comment - don't just say does not recognise my station- that helps no-one. We'd like to do Overground stations, but National Rail charge for the use of their APIs whilst providing a free skill - so whilst this uneven playing field exists we cannot provide other stations.\n\nDespite the poor reviews we do have 100s of users using this skill evey day who clearly find it useful. We've made it as easy and fast to use. We tell you the status of the tube when you launch it and it remembers your home and work stations so you can quickly find your next train.\n\nThis is Version 3.0 with fixes to the looping issues in Station choosing and support of DLR as well as Tube stations.\n\nFind the times and routes for your trains on the London Underground.\n\nIf you ask \"Whens my train\" you are taken through a setup where you define your home and work(usual destination) station.\n\nAlternatively you can ask \"Train from Baker Street to Oval\" which will set the home station to Baker Street and work station to Oval.\n\nIndividually you can change your home station with \"Make my home station Baker Street\".\n\nOnce you have defined your home and work stations you can then ask \"when\", \"later\", \"earlier\", \"train at 14:00\" etc", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
