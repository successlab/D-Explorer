We have been. After exploration, research and development, we have arrived at this point: Wait Less. \n\nWait Less can help with choosing which hospital's emergency department to visit. It tells us how far it is, how long we need to get there, and more. \n\nTo start, say something like 'ask wait less for advice', or simply 'ask wait less for a hospital'. It will ask for your suburb (where you are) and suggest an option. \n\nWait Less currently operates within the state of New South Wales, Australia. \n\nDisclaimer\nTo have accurate information in an emergency, please call 911 or your local emergency response number.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis skill has the foundation of a team project so the author(s) would like to acknowledge the stream of support and material contributions from Ian Muir, Vinod Ralh, Mohib, Sarah Coulson, and Alex Yu.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
