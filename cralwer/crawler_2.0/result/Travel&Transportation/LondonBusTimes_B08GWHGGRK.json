It'll be saved for later. Tip: We need the stop name you're travelling from. The stop name will be on your bus stop, like 'Baker Street Station' or 'Victor Road'.\n\n\"Ask bus times to save stop\"\n>> if you want to change the saved stop, just ask. \n\n\"Ask bus times\"\n>> We'll use your saved stop and quickly get the times\n\n\"Ask bus times to reset\"\n>> This forgets your saved stop.\n\nThe skill uses the live TfL feed to find out when the bus is coming for your saved stop. The skill doesn't use your private data to get your address, so you need to say which stop you want the first time.\n\nTips:\n> There are around 13,000 bus stops which can make recognising them tricky. For longer bus stop names, try saying the words with a short gap in-between to help Alexa recognise\n> Some of the stop names from TfL use abbreviations like 'Stn' which can also make it tricky to recognise. Try spelling these out\n> Don't use destinations like 'Northolt'. You need to give the name of the stop you're departing from which is on the sign at the top of the bus stop. You can look them up on TfL's website or in Google Maps when you click on a stop.\n\nIf you're having problems finding your stop, email techandsoftwareltd@outlook.com\n\nNotes about the data used: The arrivals data is supplied by TfL Open Data: \"Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2016 and Geomni UK Map data \u00a9 and database rights 2019.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
