All data is obtained using the Aviation Weather ADDS website (https://aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver). You can ask tower to obtain weather using the first few words of the airport, the city, or the 4-letter phonetic (ICAO) airport identifier. For example:\n\n- Alexa, ask Control Tower what is the weather at Portland International Airport\n\n- Alexa, ask Control Tower what is the weather at Burbank\n\n- Alexa, ask Control Tower what is the weather at KILO VICTOR NOVEMBER YANKEE\n\nNote that if you ask by name, Control Tower attempts to first match for airports that start with the name given. If none of the airports matches the name, it will look for airpots that are in the city with the name specified. If you are searching for Portland Hillsboro Airport in Hillsboro, Oregon, you have to ask for \"Portland Hillsboro\" since there is an airport that starts with \"Hillsboro\" (KINJ).\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any suggestions or bug fixes: tower@3wells.net\n\nAs always, please remember that this is merely a tool and do not rely on any information given by this application for flight planning.
