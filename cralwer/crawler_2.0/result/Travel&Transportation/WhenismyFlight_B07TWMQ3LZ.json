The reasons others don't have all this information is because the complete high quality data is only available if you pay for it. We pay for it and then make it even better by cross checking with other feeds and offer it to you for free for the first 10 sessions with us. \n\nJust tell us your flight number and we\u2019ll give you the choice of flights on different days and then tell you when it takes off and lands. In order to do this we provide access to several paid for and free data feeds used by the airline industry and for the first 10 sessions we provide this totally free to you. \n\nYou get the first 10 sessions in the premium mode for free to you, you can decide to pay for future premium sessions or use the totally free variant, which uses just the free non commercial data feeds. The premium version has high quality data (which we buy from a commercial provider) and is highly functional allowing users to see the schedules for old, current and future flights (where our premium data feed gives us access), as well as real time information to see if a flight is running early or late.\n\nThe free version is still functional for current flights with no access to flight schedules \u2013 it has real time data on where an airborne plane is currently (what country it is flying over and even the closest town) and how long it will be to its landing.\n\nThis application is designed to give you the highest quality data and functionality and that is why we pay commercial suppliers for the premium data and this is why we have to charge you for the premium sessions once you free trial is ended - if you pay for the premium version, it does help us improve this software as well as covering our costs. We have also put considerable effort into using free data feeds and continue to improve on them. Currently we cannot find free flight schedule information but if this becomes available we will use it too. For now though only the premium service provides as accurate information as is commercially available on the schedules and whether or not the flight is running early or late.\n\nFor both the premium and free versions you can asked \"where is my flight now\" and it will tell you where the flight is currently flying over if it is airborne.\n\nTo tell us you flight number say \"My flight is AA114\". Some of the time Alexa does struggle with some letter combinations (she seems particularly sensitive with the letter A), if this happens just say the Airline name instead, so in this case it would be \"My flight is American 114\". \n\nWhen using the premium version say \"today\", \"tomorrow\", \"day after tomorrow\" or \"day before yesterday\" to find a particular flight quickly. You can also use \"later\" and \"earlier\".\n\nSee demo video at: https://youtu.be/EL_QoMwJsCk", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
