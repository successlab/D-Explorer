The stop is saved, after than just ask for 'next tram'. The skill uses the live arrivals feed from TfL and will read them out.\n\nFor example, you can ask for \"next tram from Addiscombe\". After that, just ask for the \"next tram\" to get the Addiscombe arrivals again.\n\nMore info about saved results:\n\u2022 The stop you last asked for is saved\n\u2022 Ask for 'next stop' and the saved information from the previous query is used\n\u2022 Ask to forget the stop and the stored stop will be cleared. Subsequent enquiries will then also ask for the stop without saving it\n\u2022 Ask to reset the settings, and the original behaviour is restored\n\nKnown issues:\nStops at the end of the line don't always get results as the feed from TfL doesn't include scheduled departures.\n\nNotes about the data used: The arrivals data is supplied by TfL Open Data: \"Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2016 and Geomni UK Map data \u00a9 and database rights 2019.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
