It will even work out foreign travel, say from London to Berlin, provided there is a recognisable route. You can optionally specify a mode of travel.\n \nA selection of other things you can say:\nhow long will it take to get to London from Oxford\nhow long will it take to walk from London Paddington to Oxford Circus\nwhat\u2019s the journey time between London Paddington and London Victoria by tube\nhow long will it take to drive from London to Berlin\n\nThe skill\u2019s main function recognises place names for starting point and destination to deliver the distance and estimated travel time for a journey. Optionally you can also specify a mode of transport, like car, walking, cycling, or public transport (bus, train, underground/subway)\n\nFor example if you say:\n\u201cAlexa, ask Time Travel how long will it take to get from London Paddington to Oxford by train\u201d\nAlexa picks out \u201cLondon Paddington\u201d, \u201cOxford\u201d and \u201ctrain\u201d and will respond with:\n\u201c\u201dIt is 63.2 miles from London Paddington to Oxford, it should take you about 1 hour 3 mins by train.\u201d\n\nTip: if either your starting point or destination is a small village say the village and county or use postcodes for improved accuracy. \n\nComing Soon:\nSupport for desired departure and arrival times\nEstimated costs of public transport\nLots more\u2026..\n\n\nFor more info visit: http://boldstart.co.uk/time-travel-alexa-skill/", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
