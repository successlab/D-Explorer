Assets A and C generate returns of ten and eight percent respectively, with relatively high production variation. Asset B makes return of two percent at much lower variance. Taking into account of your investing style (aggressive, conservative, or moderate) and portfolio allocation, Basin Game calculates the portfolio\u2019s expected return and volatility, as well as comes up with a set of weights that best matches your investing style. For example, use modern portfolio metric, minimum variance for conservative, Sharpe\u2019s ratio aggressive, and moderate approach in between. Play what-if and learn how well your stated style and allocation agree with each other. The goal is developing a better feel for how asset allocation drives risk\u2013return trade off, and shapes portfolio volatility.
