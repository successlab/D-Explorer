Of course, we will bring in guests from other places and have a ton of fun learning from those outside our realm, but we want to have a heavy focus on showing off Gainesville's talent and what makes this place so special. We are on a mission to KEEP our talented students coming out of UF, a top ten public university HERE in Gainesville. We want to help Gainesville businesses recruit top talent to Gainesville, FL. We want to help Gainesville bring in new businesses. We want to help the small businesses in Gainesville learn from others and from one another in order to grow and be more fruitful. \n\nWELCOME TO GAINESVILLE\u2019S PODCAST.\n\nLET'S BE FRIENDS:\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/collinaustin\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/thecollinaustin\nSnapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/ns4lcollin\nWebsite: http://collinaustin.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/realcollin\nMedium: http://medium.com/@collinaustin\n\nCONNECT WITH MY CO-HOST, TY RUCAREAN:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bestofgainesville/\n\nJoin us for this journey and listen here:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/whoa-gnv-podcast/id1381002391?mt=2&i=1000410719480\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/whoagnv\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW1tLSw2Z5MB6Yebj_2pDJA\nStitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/whoa-gnv-podcast?refid=stpr\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3vZ0Bg4FJmdx3VPKg4ehMf\nOvercast: https://overcast.fm/itunes1381002391/whoa-gnv-podcast", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
