Our skill solves the problem of finding companies with similar names by voicing back to the user to be more specific. For example, you may say price for \" Southwest\" and we will find many companies that have that company name. We ask you to be more specific, and you would say \"Southwest Airlines\" if that is the stock you would like to hear.\n\nGet Stock retrieves stock data from yahoo and is not guaranteed to have real-time stock price information, therefore only should be used as a general reference and not for making stock trading decisions.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
