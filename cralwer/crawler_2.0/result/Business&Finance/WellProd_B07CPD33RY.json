It takes into account the initial well production, Arps type curve and annual decline rates suitable for use in conventional and unconventional wells. Well Prod converts all these into a metric of cumulative volume of production in the first year, ultimate recovery, and production half life (length of time to reach half of the total production volume over the life of the well). In assessing productivity of a well, Well Prod\u2019s flexibility allows quick \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios and sensitivity analysis to appraise the risk or variability, leading to more prudent investment decisions.
