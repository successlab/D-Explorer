Once you enable the skill, simply request Alexa to \"Ask the Fool for Apple,\" for example, and you'll get the share price and today's performance (and check your mobile app to see more data like trading volume, P/E ratio, and price range). If there are stocks you follow regularly (and sorry, for now we just cover stocks), it's easy to create a watchlist by adding and removing companies. Then, once you've built your list, just say, \"Ask the Fool how my stocks are doing,\" and Alexa will report the overall movement of your watchlist and the day's biggest mover and your complete watchlist can be viewed on your mobile app!. It's a simple way to track your investments.\n\nIf you see something that's not working or you have a suggestion on the features, send an email to fool@witlingo.com\n\nThis skill was designed, built and is being hosted by Witlingo.
