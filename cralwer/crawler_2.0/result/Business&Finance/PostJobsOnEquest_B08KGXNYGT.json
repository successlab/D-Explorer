An eQuest user creates a job within their ATS (Applicant Tracking System). Any time after that function is completed, they can call up the app and locate the job by job title and location. Once found, the app will inform the user of the available job sites that have pre-established within eQuest. The user can verbally select one or more job sites for job delivery. The user can also ask for a posting status for previously posted jobs.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
