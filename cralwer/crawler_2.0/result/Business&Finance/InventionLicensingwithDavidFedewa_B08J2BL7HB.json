He has been featured in Inc. and Entrepreneur\u2019s online publications on licensing and negotiation strategy. He has licensed five of his own products, with one being featured on Time magazine, CHIVE, and CNET Father\u2019s Day Product of The Year list. David and his team built the world\u2019s largest actively managed database of companies that license new innovative products. His strengths lie where business and psychology meet. While coaching students through multi-million dollar negotiations, he not only looks at the present deal at hand but teaches strategies that can be used in constructing deals with a win-win scenario throughout life.\n\nIt's people that make a company. That's why Invent Tribe has more of a personal mission than a company one. Our personal mission is to have an inventor license a product every day of the year. That's 365 licensing deals a year from Invent Tribe members!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
