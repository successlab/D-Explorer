Meaning, you initiate the Alexa wake word (\"Alexa, Open LEAP\"), then proceed to give instructions. \n\nTo start a conversation with LEAP Assistant you can say;\n\"Alexa, Open LEAP\" \n\nAlexa should respond with \"Welcome to LEAP, how can I help\"?\n\nAt this point, you could do any of the following;\n\n---------------\nFee creation\n---------------\n1. \"Create a new fee for one hundred dollars\"\n\n2. \"Create a new fee of one hundred dollars for matter {matter name / number}\" \n\n3. \"Create a new fee of one hundred dollars for matter {matter name / number} with description email to client\"\n\n---------------\nTime Entries\n---------------\n1. \"Create a new time entry\"\n\n2. \"Create a new time entry for three units\"\n\n3. \"Create a new time entry for three units on matter {matter name / number}\"\n\n4. \"Create a new time entry for three units on matter {matter name / number} with description email to client\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nTime Entries also support minutes and hours\n-----------------------------------------------------\n1. \"Create a new time entry for twelve minutes\"\n\n2. \"Create a new time entry for one hour and thirty minutes on matter {matter name / number}\"\n\nAlexa learns and grows with you and your voice. The above examples are only some of the supported utterances it can handle. Over time, you'll notice there are many ways to achieve the desired functionality. \n\n---------------\nExpense Recovery creation\n---------------\n1. \"Create a new expense recovery for one hundred dollars\"\n\n2. \"Create a new expense recovery of one hundred dollars for matter {matter name / number}\" \n\n3. \"Create a new expense recovery of one hundred dollars for matter {matter name / number} with description email to client\"\n\n------------\nAdvanced\n------------\nThe LEAP Assistant supports single phrase utterances, meaning the above examples can all be used outside of the \"conversation\" scope. However, this is typically a little more difficult to execute accurately, until you get to learn the Alexa device and visa versa. \n\nFor example, you could use any example above, in one sentence; \n\"Alexa, Open LEAP and create a new fee of one hundred dollars for matter {matter name / number}\"\n\nThis flow typically comes more natural for advanced / experienced users, as they can find it quicker to execute their needs.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
