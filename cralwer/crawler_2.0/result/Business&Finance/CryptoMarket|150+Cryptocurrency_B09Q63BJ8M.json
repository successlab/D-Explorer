It supports more than 150 cryptocurrencies in 300+ currencies from coinbase's market. For instance, say \"Alexa, ask crypto market to get BTC price in EUR\". By default, the currency is set to USD.\n\nThe skill also supports a customized configured crypto price result, using multipliers or the number of decimals you want to hear from Alexa, like this one: \"Alexa, ask crypto market to get SHIB price in USD multiplied by 10000 with 2 decimals\".\n\nAs the cryptocurrency and currency values are not very easy to tell to Alexa device, I strongly recommend you to use the skill in an Alexa routine, by adding a customized Alexa action with the crypto market you want to know about, like \"Alexa, ask crypto market to get SHIB price in USD multiplied by 10000 with 2 decimals\".\n\nIf Alexa couldn't find your favorite cryptocurrency, please send me a feedback, in order to update the cryptocurrency list.\n\nPlease leave a Review and share this Skill with everyone.\nFeel free to contact me if you have any suggestions: catalin.moldovan97@icloud.com\n\nNote\n------\n- Real-time cryptocurrency price is provided by coinbase's market.\n- It is not intended for commercial use and provider/author is not responsible for your crypto investment decisions.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
