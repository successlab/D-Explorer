It needs to be connected to a Power BI Dashboard by saying \"Alexa, open dashboard assistant\". Once it is connected to a dashboard, you can ask your queries e.g. What is my Sales for January this year? It will fetch the required details from the Power BI report and give it back to you in form of voice over. To ask questions about about a specific report it needs to connect to that report first and then you can query it. for eg. to get answers for blra/cra billing report needs to be get/opened. So, first ask alexa to get/open blra report and then you can query something like 'what is blra for january 2022'. Similarly to get answers for otif you need to get fulfillment report.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
