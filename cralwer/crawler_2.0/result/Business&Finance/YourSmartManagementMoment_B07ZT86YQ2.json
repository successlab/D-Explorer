This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "Effective management is the most challenging part of growing, running and leading a business. One of the key reasons why is little training if any is done and what training is available does not include a critical piece of knowledge and that is the role human behavior plays in business operations. Here's the bottom line - everything about business is about human behavior. Unless leaders understand that - they will continually undermine the very results they are working so hard to achieve.\n\nOne additional challenge is the lack of continuity in development. We've created a blueprint that key leaders can follow to embeds principles of human behavior science, integrating business and people acumen with a step by step - 9 building block format.\n\nImagine trying to build a house with no blueprint or foundation and yet that's what business owners and their senior leaders attempt to do. We've remedied that with our smart management blueprint so you can do just that. It's an easy to follow roadmap that is reliable, sustainable and can be used for prepromotion and succession planning. It simultaneously fine-tunes operations, fosters high-performing teams while developing competent managers.\n\nLearn more at : www.manageglobal.solutions", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
