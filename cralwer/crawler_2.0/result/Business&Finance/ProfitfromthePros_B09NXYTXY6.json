The Zacks #1 Rank Performance covers a period beginning on January 1, 1988 to November 1, 2021. These returns are from hypothetical portfolios consisting of stocks with Zacks Rank #1 that were rebalanced monthly (see additional details regarding rebalancing below) with zero transaction costs. These are not the returns of actual portfolios of stocks. Zacks Rank #1 stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank #1 stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank #1 stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank #1 stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Rank #1 stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank #1 stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index.
