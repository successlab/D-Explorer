It is so vital for your business, but just as overwhelming to get a grasp on.\n\nThis flash briefing is a convenient way to get a grip on what branding can mean for your company's longevity and growth.\n\nWhose the host? Well, name is Jeffrey Maxim. I'm a 21 year old learning branding through interviews with business owners and brand strategists. In addition, each month I try a different brand strategy framework authored by an expert like Marty Neumeier, Julia Braga, Fabian Geyrhalter, etc. I ask experts very basic questions so you don't have to.\n\nI started in May 2019 with no knowledge, and am steadily forming a concrete understanding of what branding can mean practically for a business. \n\nFind me on IG @ineyesight and LinkedIn at Jeffrey Maxim Listen to In EyeSight podcast on Spotify and other podcast platforms.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
