No sign-up required -- just add our skill and say open Help Me Buy My New Home. You can set as broad or narrow of a search that you would like. Ask for results after just one search term and see what all is on the market for sale or add another search term when asked. If you would like to add another property characteristic, you can ask for another search term to be added. Want to look at just three bedrooms? Say it, don't click it. Want to locate listings in a certain city or on a particular street? Say it, don't click it. What you're looking for can be found by property address or M. L. S. numbers as well. Say it, don't click it. Help Me Buy My New Home, changing the way you search for real estate. Say it, don't click it.\n\nTo perform a property characteristic search, say something like \"search for homes with between three and four bedrooms.\" Once you tell Alexa your first property characteristic, she will tell you the number of properties for sale that match that characteristic, and then ask if you want to add another characteristic or hear the list of properties matching your search. You can keep adding property characteristics, one at a time, until you are satisfied with your search. Once you are ready to hear your search results, Alexa will read a short description of each property; you can check the Alexa app for more details on each listing. \n\nFor best results, do not try to mix property characteristics in a single statement. Currently, the skill supports the following property characteristics:\n\nsquare footage: some examples are \"give me properties with at least 1800 square feet\" or \"show me listings with between 1000 and 1200 square feet.\" Make sure to say the words \"square feet.\"\n\nyear built: some examples are \"look for properties built after 2000\" or \"tell me about houses built before 1990.\" Currently the skill only supports actual year built, not age, so statements like \"search for properties that are at least ten years old\" will not work.\n\nprice: some examples are \"give me information about properties that cost between 200,000 and 300,000 dollars\" or \"give me info on homes that cost at most 1,000,000 dollars.\" Make sure to say the word \"dollars.\" \n\nnumber of bedrooms: some examples are \"look for properties with 3 bedrooms\" or \"give me listings with between 5 and 7 bedrooms.\" Make sure to say the word \"bedrooms.\"\n\nnumber of bathrooms: some examples are \"search for houses with more than 2.5 bathrooms\" or \"tell me about listings with between 3 and 4 bathrooms.\" Make sure to say the word \"bathrooms.\"\n\ncity: some examples are \"give me properties in Destin\" or \"search for listings in Santa Rosa Beach.\" Most cities along the Emerald Coast of Florida are supported.\n\nproperty type: some examples are \"show me mobile homes\" or \"tell me about condos\" or \"give me information on houses\" or \"search for commercial sales.\"\n\nYou can change property characteristics without beginning a new search. For example, if you previously said \"search for properties with at least 5 bedrooms\" but Alexa found no properties, you can say \"show me properties with at least 3 bedrooms\" while leaving all other property characteristics the same. You can continue adding and changing parameters and hearing search results, or say \"new search\" to begin a new search.\n\nTo perform an M. L. S. number or property address search, say something like \"tell me about property address 5437 Griffith Mill\" or \"show me information on M.L.S. number 768746.\" If a property currently for sale matches that property address or M. L. S. number, Alexa will read a short description about that property and then exit the skill; you can check the Alexa app for more details on that listing. \n\nFollow along with the Alexa app on your mobile device to see what Alexa hears. Go to Settings, then History in the Alexa app.\n\nFor more information visit www.buyafloridavacationhome.com/amazonalexa.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
