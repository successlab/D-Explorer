I have worked as a developer, a VP of Dev, and a CTO. I have also founded a few startups, raised money, and actively angel invest. I understand business and I understand tech. I combine my skills at SerpicoDEV.\n\nSerpicoDEV builds software for entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses. We have been around for 10 years, have nearly 25 people, and helped over 100 businesses.\n\nSo why entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses? I believe it takes a very special kind of person to be an entrepreneur. A kind of person that is willing to put it all on the line to make their dream a reality. I personally find it very rewarding to work with entrepreneurs that dream big, risk big, and take action. That's why SerpicoDEV caters exclusively to entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses. \n\nWe have no contracts and we have no minimums, So it's real easy to get started with us. So if you're an entrepreneur that dream big and takes action, and you want your software developed right, on-time, and in-budget... come and talk to me.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
