Your holdings can be divided into metal-specific 'wallets' however you want. For instance, you can create a gold wallet called 'Eagles' and a gold wallet called 'Maples'. Asking this skill to 'list my wallets' would then give you the values of your eagles and maples separately. Or, asking this skill 'my balance' would total them up for you.\n\nTo change how your metal wallets are grouped, or to add/remove holdings, simply disable and re-enable this skill, and you'll be able to provide a new set of holdings.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
