Allen Hanes and I can help any business triple their leads, double their sales and add an additional $15,000 to $100,000 to their annuel revenue without spending an additional dime on marketing or advertising.\n\nMore Leads\n\nThe most expensive and difficult function of any business is acquiring new customers. The reason it's difficult has nothing to do with you, your business or your marketing. It has to do with the growth of the Internet and the tremendous number of scams and charlatans that lurk online offering every bogus product and service you can imagine.\nPeople today are often highly skeptical of any product, service or offer\u2026 both offline and online. Consider the last time you heard an offer that you thought sounded valuable. You more than likely discovered that the offer came with certain restrictions, mandatory conditions or a buyer beware non-guaranteed transaction. Prospects buy with their eyes\u2026 not their ears. They also need to know, like and trust you before they will buy what you're offering. Or they need to know and trust the person that's recommending what you sell.\nMany of today's top marketing professionals are calling it \"the single, most powerful lead generation and revenue-generating program\" available today.\n\nMore Conversions\n\nHow would you like to sell more of your products or services... without increasing your traffic?\nIf that's your goal, then you need to improve your conversion rate.\nBusiness owners are always looking for the magic formula that can optimize the performance of their lead generation efforts. Unfortunately, there is NO magic bullet\u2026 just a systemized process that can double or triple your current conversion rates.\nLet's face the facts. I've seen just a slight change to a headline, one item added to a bulleted list, or the placement of a video on a website pay off in massive ways.\nSometimes even seemingly tiny changes \u2014 the headline color or the words you use on your buy button \u2014 can instantly double your sales.\nGenerating a multitude of leads is worthless unless you can convert the vast majority of those leads into actual sales.\n\nSo how would you like to know the secrets to converting all of your leads into paying clients?\n\nMore Transactions\n\nIncreasing the number of times your customers purchase from you\nrepresents a profound and simple business-building strategy that\ncan easily double or triple your profits immediately,\nyet few businesses ever use it.\nIf you have a business that has current customers, then you already have a relationship established with them. You have already invested substantial marketing dollars and resources to attract and keep them as customers.\n\nNow is the time to put into place specific revenue-generating strategies to help them purchase more often so they benefit even greater from your product or service.\n\nHow would you like to see an immediate 15% increase in total revenue WITHOUT spending any additional time, money or effort to get it?\nWhat if we could give you a strategy that would practically FORCE these customers to not only come in for their oil change at 3000 miles\u2026 but to consistently come in BEFORE they reach that interval?\n\nListen in daily as I cover these and other little known marketing strategies.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
