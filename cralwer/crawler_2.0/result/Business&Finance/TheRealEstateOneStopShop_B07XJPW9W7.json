Today, we've evolved with our commitment to provide the consumer with an easy to use, single go-to platform to programming all things real estate for the Voice User, as well. We have simplified the process of buying, selling, maintaining, financing, and referring real estate so you don't have to. Real estate has never been so easy!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
