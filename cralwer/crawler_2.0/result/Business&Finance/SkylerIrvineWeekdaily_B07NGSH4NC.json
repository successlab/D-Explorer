Also featuring highlight clips from interviews and conversations with the leading marketers and executives who are pushing the limits on a daily basis. \n\nSKYLER IRVINE MEANS BUSINESS\nMy name is Skyler Irvine and I am a serial entrepreneur, investor and CEO of RenzlerMedia, a full service digital marketing and media agency in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nI have been building businesses since I was 24 years old and was fired from my only corporate job. As a business owner, I have always been obsessed with efficiency and maximizing the value of every dollar I spend. To me, the concept of content marketing is a no brainer. I don\u2019t believe in this strategy because I own a digital media company, I started my digital media company because of how much I believe in this strategy.\n\nAt 24, I started my first company buying foreclosed homes and turning them into occupied rentals for my own portfolio. Shortly after banks stopped lending to me so I pivoted to private hard money lending with shorter investment periods.\n\nAs the market recovered, I shifted my real estate investing business into a retail real estate company helping others buy and sell homes. Through leveraging the free tools provided by Facebook, I grew this business to $21+ Million in annual sales without an increase in my marketing budget. In 2015 I published my first book: How To Leverage Your Real Estate Business With Facebook.\n\nIn 2016, I left the real estate business and spent one full year making videos on YouTube, learning everything I could about video production in the digital world.\n\nIn January of 2017, I launched RenzlerMedia with the mission to do for other businesses what I had done building mine over the years: dominating in the areas that my competitors were overlooking rather than try and outspend in the areas they already dominated.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
