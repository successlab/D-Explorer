Through personal stories and real-life conversations, this show takes you into the room with managers and employees where real culture change happens, and shows you a new kind of employee mentoring where each person gets the real-time feedback, support, and clear boundaries we all need to get beyond the patterns that hold us back.\n\n\u201cGood Authority is a modern classic, and it will redefine what it means to be the boss.\u201d\n- Seth Godin, Author, Linchpin\n\nGood Authority is hosted by Jonathan Raymond of Refound, who brings together what he has learned over a twenty-year journey as an executive, entrepreneur, team leader and leadership trainer.\n\nCombining his experience as the CEO and CBO of EMyth where he led the transformation of a global coaching brand with the lessons learned along his own personal growth journey, Jonathan walks us through a step-by-step approach that integrates the leading edges of both. You ll discover a way to lead your team that is both profoundly human and results-oriented at the same time.\n\nWhether you re a CEO or business owner, executive, team leader, consultant, or coach, Good Authority will give you new ideas and inspiration you can put into practice. Most importantly, it will give you permission to be more of who you are at work than you ever thought possible.\n\nYour leaders and managers know how to get things done-it\u2019s what got them the promotion. \n\nNow they have a new challenge: continuing to deliver on their individual contributions while bringing out the best in others. With a tried and tested approach to weaving culture, values, business objectives and the way your people work to bring out the best in everyone, you\u2019ll have a partner that understands how to make professional and personal growth come to life and provides tools for managing teams that your people leaders will actually use.\n\nOur core belief goes into the one-of-a-kind people leadership and culture programs we design and deliver for high-growth organizations who know that feedback, accountability, and everyday coaching conversations are what it takes to be truly people-first. \n\nSeparating personal and professional growth in the workplace makes it difficult to connect on what matters, at scale and in the long run. Without knowing how to coach effectively, most people managers give feedback that\u2019s too intense too early, without boundaries and consequences, or both.\n\nEmployees want coaching - actionable feedback about their work and trajectory - as well as transparency and real communication from their manager.\n\nPeople Leaders want something simple - a methodology that makes it clear what feedback to give, when, and with what degree of urgency.\n\nLeaders want high-performance - a team of people who take personal ownership of the work and don\u2019t need to be micromanaged.\n\nThe Refound Solution\n\n1 - We assume that personal and professional growth are necessary and inseparable in today\u2019s workplace and that the role of the people leader is to walk this talk.\n\n2 - We believe the way to get people more engaged with their work and growth is to be more engaged with them. This means using everyday conversations to support, guide, and celebrate learning.\n\n3 - We train our clients on targeted practices for how to give feedback, have effective one-on-ones, be appropriately transparent with your team, create a culture of accountability, in one coherent philosophical framework that avoids confusion for people leaders at all levels who are moving fast and need training that is relevant to the work in front of them.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
