Use phrases like 'What's in my portfolio' to see what you're currently holding. You can also retrieve the value of your portfolio in GBP, EUR, USD or JPY by saying 'How much is my portfolio worth'.\n\nAnother great feature to make use of is the prediction feature, which uses the Low, High, Open, Close and Volume values from yesterday to predict the price that Bitcoin will close at tomorrow. You can use this to see whether buying some Bitcoin would be a good idea today\n\nAlthough the prediction is quite accurate, there is no guarantee that it will close at that value and so use it to invest AT YOUR OWN RISK", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
