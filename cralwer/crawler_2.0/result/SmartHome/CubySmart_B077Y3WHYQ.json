A Cuby Smart device (www.cuby.mx)\n2. The Cuby Smart App for iOS or Android\n3. A Cuby Smart Account with at least 1 configured Cuby\n\nSteps:\n1. Enable the Skill\n2. Link your Cuby Account to Alexa by typing your Cuby username and password\n3. Run \"Discover Devices\" in Alexa or ask Alexa to discover devices by saying: \"Alexa, discover devices\"\n\nYou will now be able to control your Air Conditioner by using your voice. \n\nTo have the best experience, name your Cubies (inside the Cuby App) using simple names that Alexa can understand and pronounce easily. Avoid having similar names among Cubies. No special characters are allowed. If you ever change the name of the Cuby, you will need to re-discover devices so that Alexa gets the updated names.\n\nImportant:\nDo not name your devices \"Air\", \"Air Conditioner\" or \"Aircon\" since that will make Alexa send the wrong command.\n\nSome sample commands ( <device> is the name of the Cuby or Group):\n\n\"Alexa, turn on <device> \"\nWill turn ON the A/C.\n\n\"Alexa, turn off <device> \"\nWill turn OFF the A/C.\n\n\"Alexa, set <device> to <X> Degrees\"\nWill set the A/C to <X> Degrees. Alexa will respond with the current A/C mode too so that you know what setting is currently active.\n\n\"Alexa, set <device> to <mode> Mode\"\nWill set the A/C to <mode> mode. Possible modes are \"Cool\", \"Heat\", \"Auto\".\n\n\"Alexa, make <device> warmer \"\nWill increase the A/C temperature by 1 degree.\n\n\"Alexa, make <device> cooler\"\nWill decrease the A/C temperature by 1 degree.\n\n\"Alexa, increase <device> by <X> degrees\"\nWill increase the A/C temperature by <X> degrees.\n\n\"Alexa, decrease <device> by X degrees\"\nWill decrease the A/C temperature by X degrees.\n\n\"Alexa, what is temperature of the <device> \"\nAlexa will tell you the temperature that the Cuby read with it's internal temperature sensor.\n\n\"Alexa, what is <device> set to?\"\n\"Alexa, is <device> ON?\"\nAlexa will report the last mode and temperature the A/C was set to using Cuby (if you use the original remote control, it may report an incorrect state).\n\nIf you need support using this skill, please contact us at: www.cuby.mx (help@cuby.mx)\n\nIf you device is not showing or if it has a different name than then one shown in the Cuby App, try discovering devices again.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
