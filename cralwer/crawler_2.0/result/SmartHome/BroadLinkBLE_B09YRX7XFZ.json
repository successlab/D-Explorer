Download and install BroadLink BLE App and Alexa App\nSearch \"BroadLink BLE\" App from App Store or Google Play (NOT \"BroadLink\" App). After installation, you don't need to sign up an account for quick use. Alexa App is also required to be installed before linking.\n\n2. Add and control devices\nFollow device manuals to set up devices and gateway/hub in BroadLink BLE App and make sure you can remotely control them via external networks (temporarily disable Bluetooth and use 3G/4G) - because Alexa voice control requires Internet connection.\n\n3. Link with Alexa\nIn BroadLink BLE App, click \"Me\" > \"Link with voice services\" and choose \"Amazon Alexa\". Just click \"Link now\" and you will be redirected to Alexa App and click again \"Link\" to complete.\nAnother way is to search \"BroadLink BLE\" skill in Alexa App and click \"Enable\", then click \"Agree and Link\" to complete.\nNo credentials are required during linking.\n\n4. Discover devices\nAfter linking with Alexa, click \"DISCOVER DEVICES\" on next page in Alexa App. Alexa will automatically discover devices you've added in BroadLink BLE and show them up.\nLater if you have new devices added in BroadLink BLE App, they can be automatically show up in Alexa App and Echo will also announce the discovery.\nThe device name you set in BroadLink BLE App will be automatically synced to Alexa and you can edit either in BroadLink App or Alexa App.\n\n4. Control device by voice\nNow you can say to Alexa for voice control. For example, if you named a smart bulb as \u201cLamp\u201d, you could say: \u201cAlexa, turn off Lamp\u201d, \u201cAlexa, set Lamp to blue\u201d, \u201cAlexa, set Lamp to warm white\u201d or \u201cAlexa, dim Lamp to 50%\u201d.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf Alexa returns voice \u201cthe device isn\u2019t responding\u201d, it may because the gateway/hub is offline.
