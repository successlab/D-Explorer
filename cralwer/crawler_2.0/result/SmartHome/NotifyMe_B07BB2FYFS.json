This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: notify me\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 264", "des": "Take control of your Alexa by sending it your _own_ notifications. This skill is perfect for people into home automation (\"A leak has been detected in the laundry room\"), home security (\"Your garage door has been open for over an hour\"), and many other creative uses you might think up (\"It's Tuesday. Did you put out the trash?\").\n\nThis is an admittedly nerdy skill for, well, nerds who are at least somewhat familiar using RESTful APIs.\n\nTo get started, just enable the skill, giving it permission to send notifications to your Alexa and linking it to your Amazon account so we can send a unique access code to the email address associated with that account. Next, just say, \"Alexa, open Notify Me\" and the skill will introduce itself and send your access code via email.\n\nWith your access code in hand, you are ready to go. Please visit www.notifymyecho.com for instructions on how to start \"notifying\" yourself!\n\nProblems, questions, or compliments? Please contact us at info@notifymyecho.com\n\nAnother clever skill from www.thomptronics.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
