You can now call out your control and it will control your devices within a zone or the entire premise. \n\nBefore you start using switch map, ensure your premise has a SwitchMap system installed with gateway (smartphone) control. Once you are ready, open the Amazon Alexa app and add \"SwitchMap Voice Assistant\" skill to your account then link it to the Network you want it to control. \n\nBefore you start calling your controls, you should assign each Echo to the zone that it is placed in. Yes, we know you have more than one echo in the house. To assign, simply call out...\n\u2022 \"Alexa, open switch map and connect to [Gateway name]\"\n\n* All zone, scene, device names are based on the Gateway/Network that it is linked to. You will need to rename the names until it is most recognizable by Alexa. For example, the word \"Lights\" is better than \"Light\". \n\nYou are now ready, to call out your commands start with...\nAlexa, tell switch map to ...\nAlexa, ask switch map to ...\nAlexa, open switch map and ...\n\nLIGHTS\n...Turn \"Device name\" on\n...
