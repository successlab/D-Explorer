StateReport *requires* account-linking to pick up your Domoticz URL and authorization credentials. \nAn installer is available to prepare Domoticz for cloud-access (it also performs App-to-App account linking). Note that neither a VPN nor the 'my.domoticz.com' service are acceptable transports! \n\nPlease see the FAQ and setup help at https://smartskills.tech/statereport/faq", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
