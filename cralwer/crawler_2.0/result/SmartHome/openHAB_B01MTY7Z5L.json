It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols. Supported technologies include KNX, Modbus, DMX, Philips Hue, PLCBus, Sonos, Plugwise, IHC/Elko, RFXCOM, Homematic, Koubachi, Pulseaudio, Samsung TV, Bluetooth, One-Wire, Novelan, Asterisk, generic serial devices and many others. You can find openHAB at http://www.openhab.org/\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nFirst make sure you have your openHAB system configured and connected to the openHAB Cloud service. openHAB Cloud accounts are free, visit https://myopenhab.org for more information.\n\nIn your openHAB configuration, add the Alexa metadata to the items you wish to expose to Amazon Alexa. Any number, dimmer, switch or thermostat mode (string or number) is supported.\n\nFinally enable the openHAB skill for Amazon Alexa. When prompted, use your openHAB Cloud account credentials to link your system to Amazon Alexa.\n\nOnce linked, any items you have configured with the Alexa metadata will be discoverable and automatically available to Amazon Alexa. If you add additional items after linking, just ask Alexa to \"Discover Devices\" to add them to your Amazon Alexa account.\n\nYou can control items in your openHAB system directly, for example:\n - Alexa, turn on kitchen\n\nYou can also add your items to Alexa groups to control multiple items at once, for example:\n - Alexa, set bedroom to 50 percent\n\nScenes and routines can also be used to control multiple openHAB items, for example:\n - Alexa, turn on bedtime.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
