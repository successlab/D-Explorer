We've worked hard to build a list of easy-to-remember commands to let you intuitively interact with your CERV through your Alexa device.\n\nWant to know what your indoor air quality is? Just ask! Kitchen a bit smoky from the burnt popcorn you forgot about? Tell the CERV to vent!\n\nThis skill links with your existing CERV-ICE account (if you haven't created one yet for your CERV, head on over to www.buildequinox.com/cervice) so when you enable the skill, you will log in to CERV-ICE to authorize the Alexa skill to communicate with your CERV. Once linked, your Alexa will attempt to discover your CERV, and then add it as a Smarthome device. As a Smarthome device, you can easily configure the CERV with Routines. For example, at 9:00pm every evening as you're getting ready for bed, Alexa could lower the Indoor Air Quality Setpoint to 700ppm to make sure you get plenty of fresh air while you sleep! Your imagination is the limit! \n\nThe full Alexa skill user's guide can be found at www.buildequinox.com/files/CERV-ICE_Alexa_Skill_v1.0.pdf\n\nBelow, you'll find a list of commands to ask the CERV for information, or tell it to change operation\n\nIndoor Air Quality\n Alexa, ask the CERV what the indoor air quality is\n Alexa, ask the CERV what the pollutant level is\n Alexa, ask the CERV what the IAQ is\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the CO2 level\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the VOC level\n \nIndoor Temperature / Relative Humidity\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the indoor temperature\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the indoor relative humidity\n \nAll Conditions / Current Status\n Alexa, ask the CERV what it\u2019s doing\n Alexa, ask the CERV for a state report\n Alexa, ask the CERV for its current status\n\nSet Heating Temperature Setpoint \nInput: 50F - 85F / 12C - 17C (Heating Setpoint must be below Cooling Setpoint)\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the lower setpoint to 61\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the heating to 61 Fahrenheit\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the heat to 18 Celsius\n \nGet Heating Setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the lower setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the heat set to\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the heating setpoint\n \nSet Cooling Temperature Setpoint\nInput: 50F - 85F / 12C - 17C (Cooling setpoint must be above Heating setpoint)\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the upper setpoint to 79\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the cooling to 79 Fahrenheit\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the cool setpoint to 23 Celsius\n \nGet Cooling Setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the upper setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the cooling set to\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the cooling setpoint\n \nSet IAQ Setpoint\nInput: 600ppm - 2000ppm\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the pollutant setpoint to 900\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the indoor air quality setpoint to 900 parts per million\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the ventilation setpoint to 900\n \nGet IAQ Setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the VOC setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the CO2 setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the pollutant setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the IAQ setpoint\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the indoor air quality setpoint\n\nSet Scheduled Ventilation\nInput: 0 \u2013 100%\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the scheduled ventilation to 10 percent\n\nGet Scheduled Ventilation\n Alexa, ask the CERV what\u2019s the scheduled ventilation\n\nTriggering Ventilation\nInput: 5 minutes - 120 minutes\n Alexa, tell the CERV to set the triggered ventilation to 15 minutes\n Alexa, tell the CERV to vent for 15 minutes\n\nGet Vent Time\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the triggered vent time\n Alexa, ask the CERV what's the triggered vent status\n \nCancelling Vent Time\n Alexa, tell the CERV to stop venting\n Alexa, tell the CERV to stop triggered ventilation\n Alexa, tell the CERV to cancel the ventilation timer", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
