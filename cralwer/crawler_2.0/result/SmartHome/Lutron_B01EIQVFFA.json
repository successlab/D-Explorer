You can also ask Alexa to raise and lower your Lutron shades, or set them to any level you want. To control multiple lights, fans, and shades through a single voice command, just ask Alexa to turn on your favorite scene. Need to be quiet? Use your Lutron Pico remote or keypad for those moments when silence is golden.\n\nTo add smart lighting control to your home, you\u2019ll need a Smart Bridge, main repeater, or processor linked to a Lutron account and have at least one dimmer, switch, fan control or shade associated with it. To create a Lutron account, download the Lutron App from Google Play or the App Store and tap \"Get Started.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, please reach out at any time to our free 24/7 support team at systemsupport@lutron.com / 1.844.588.7661.\n\n*NOTE \u2013 If you have a RadioRA2 or HomeWorks QS system with a Lutron Connect Bridge, please use the Lutron Connect skill.
