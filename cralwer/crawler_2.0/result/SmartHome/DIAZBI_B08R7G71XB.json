Wi-Fi Bridge (and motors) can now open or close blinds, venetians or other motorized window coverings by giving out direct voice commands to Alexa. \n\nYou can ask Alexa to open or close individual shade or to activate a scene that moves a group of shades to pre-determined positions.\n\nWith the help of \u201cRoutine\u201d feature in Alexa, you can create more native set of voice commands to activate a scene or perform group control. For example: you can say: \u201cAlexa, it\u2019s too dark\u201d and link the command to a scene that opens all shades in the living room. \n\nA few tips for users: \nYou will need to configure a Diaz B.I. Wi-Fi Bridge together with the Diaz B.I. App first before enabling the Alexa skill. \n\nPlease create an account, setup rooms, devices/shades, scenes and timers properly in the Connector App, making sure a plain and distinctive name is assigned to rooms, shades, scenes and timers, for clear recognition with voice commands. \n\nTo establish link-up with Alexa, you will be requested to submit Diaz B.I. account info, email address and password, to Alexa.\n\nAlexa Routine feature is highly recommended.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
