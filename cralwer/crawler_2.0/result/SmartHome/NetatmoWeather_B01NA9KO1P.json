You can complete your Weather Station with the Rain Gauge and the Wind Gauge.\n\nNo need to check your phone when you\u2019d like to know the temperature or if it has been raining yesterday, just ask Alexa.\nShe can retrieve all your Weather Station measurements for you:\n\u2022 Temperature inside and outside\n\u2022 Humidity inside and outside\n\u2022 Sound level and CO2 level inside\n\u2022 Pressure\n\u2022 (optional) wind direction, wind strength and rainfall\n\nTo get started, select the \u2018Enable Skill\u2019 button to link your Netatmo account to Alexa. \nYou can then start to enjoy mastering climate measurements with your voice.\nJust say commands like \u201cAlexa, ask Netatmo what\u2019s the temperature outside?\u201d to know if it\u2019s too chilly to walk the dog.\n\nIf you have several Weather Stations, e.g. named \u201cSummer House\u201d and \u201cOffice\u201d, just say the name of the Weather Station you\u2019re interested in, in your request to Alexa. For example, \u201cAlexa, ask Netatmo if it rained yesterday at the Summer House?\u201d or \u201cAlexa, ask Netatmo what is the humidity level in the Office?\u201d\n\nIf you have an additional indoor module set up, simply choose between the name of the Base Station or the Indoor Module in your request.
