To get started, select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App to link SmartIoT skill with your account and discover your devices. Find more information about connecting smart home devices at Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home).\nWhen using the skill, you need established names for your devices. If you have purchased a service package from us, the device name as opted by you for each of the devices will already be visible after the discovery process. If you have purchased a product, the product serial number will be displayed after the discovery process. In either of the cases, you have the flexibility to change the name to a name of your choice.\nYou can also create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information is available at Create a Smart Home Device Group (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups)\nOnce you know the name or group name for your devices, you can control your devices by voice. For example, you can say the following depending on your group or device name: \n\"Alexa, turn on Bedroom.\"\n\"Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72 degrees.\"\n\"Alexa, show garage camera.\"\nIf you have any questions, please visit our SmartIoT skill FAQ at https://iotmate.co.in/faqs/smartiot-skill-faq/.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
