Please note, at this time Alexa video supported devices only support RTSP/RTP streams with H.264 encoded video.\n\nA complete set of step-by-step instructions are provided via this link:\nhttps://monoclecam.com/start.html\n\nNOTE: Monocle is not a cloud service that directly hosts or provides access to your camera's audio/video feeds but rather an aggregation and integration service. To access your network camera's audio/video feeds your Amazon Echo video-enabled device must be able to directly access the camera's video/audio stream over the network. This means that the Alexa device must be on the same private network where your cameras reside or you must expose your cameras over the Internet either by placing the camera on a public Internet connection or placing it behind a router and exposing the camera's RTSP port through the router using NAT (network address translation) By far the most common approach is to simply have all your camera's and Alexa devices on the same private network.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
