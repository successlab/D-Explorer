To use this skill, you need to first set up the Alexa client service on your TV. Start the setup by launching the \"Amazon Alexa\" app from the Home screen of your TV. Follow the instructions and complete the following steps:\n- Create an Amazon account if you don't have one.\n- Select a name for your Philips Smart TV for Alexa to recognize it.\n- Register your Philips Smart TV on the Amazon server using code-based linking. \n- Enable this skill on a mobile device, link accounts, and discover your devices. \n- Return to your TV to complete setup. \n\n1. SUPPORTED MODELS\nPhilips SAPHI Smart TV models that support this feature will have the \"Amazon Alexa\" client app on the Home screen. If the selected models are bundled with a TV remote control that has an Alexa activation button, make sure your TV is paired with the remote control. Your TV must also be connected to the Internet. If the app is not on the Home screen, your TV may not be supporting this feature.\n\n2. TV NAME\nUse the TV name to tell Alexa which device to control. Pick a unique name for every TV you set up. For example: \"TV\", \"Living Room TV,\" \"Media Room TV\" etc.\n\n3. VOICE CONTROL\nYou can trigger Alexa by pressing the Alexa activation button on the TV remote (selected models only). You will need to use the TV's name when you want to control your TV with Alexa, e.g. \"volume up on TV,\" \"next channel on Living room TV,\" etc. The first time you ask Alexa to control your Philips Smart TV using the TV name, Alexa will assume any applicable commands should control the same TV for a period of time. If you want to move away from controlling your TV, here are a few of the many things that you can ask Alexa to do.\n\"What's the weather today?\" \n\"Play a song\"\n\"Read my audiobook\"\n\"Show my to-do list\"\n\"Set a 5-minute timer\"\n\"How big is the Earth?\"\n\"What's in the news?\"\n\"What did I miss?\"\n\nYou can use the following Amazon Alexa voice commands to control your Smart TV:\n\nSWITCH TV ON/OFF \n\"Turn on Living Room TV.\" (see note below)\n\"Turn off TV.\"\n\nNOTE: Switching TV On will work only if the Alexa Switch on setting is enabled in the TV via the preferred settings in the \"Amazon Alexa\" app from Home.\n\nCHANGE CHANNEL\n\"Next channel on TV.\"\n\"Change channel to 5 on TV.\"\n\"Channel down on Living Room TV.\"\n\nCHANGE VOLUME\n\"Set volume to 15 on Living Room TV.\"\n\"Decrease volume.\"\n\"Volume up.\"\n\nMUTE OR UNMUTE TV\n\"Mute Living Room TV.\"\n\"Unmute.\"\n\nCHANGE INPUT SOURCE\n\"Switch input to Blu-ray on Living Room TV\"\n\"Switch input to HDMI 1 on Living Room TV\"\n\nCONTROL PLAYBACK\n\"Play on TV.\"\n\"Pause TV.\"\n\"Fast forward.\"\n\"Rewind.\"\nCONTROL AMBILIGHT (see note below):\n\"Turn on Ambilight.\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Follow color.\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Follow video.\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Follow audio.\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Lounge light.\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Follow flag.\"\n\n\"Turn on Ambilight on Living Room TV\"\n\"Turn on Ambilight Follow video on Living Room TV\"\n\nNote: The supported Ambilight styles may depend on specific TV models. \nPlease refer the user manual of your TV to know the supported Ambilight styles.\n\nThis is an example sequence of a possible conversation with Alexa:\nYou say \"Turn on TV.\"\nAlexa says \"Okay\" and the TV powers ON.\nYou say \"Change channel to 5.\"\nAlexa says \"Okay\" and the TV tunes to channel 5.\nYou say \"Turn up the volume.\"\nAlexa says \"Okay\" and the TV volume goes up.\nYou say \"Play Beat It.\"\nAlexa says \"Okay\" and plays Beat It on the TV.\n\nSUPPORTED LANGUAGES\nEnglish, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese\n\n4.
