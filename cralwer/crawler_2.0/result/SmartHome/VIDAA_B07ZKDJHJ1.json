This Skill makes it easy to enjoy popular shows, movies and streaming content on your Smart TV. Using just your voice, you can play video and music, change channels, change volume, switch inputs, and more - Just ask Alexa!\n\nTo get started, go to Settings > System, and follow the instructions there.\nNOTE: If you do not find \u201cVoice Service\u201d or \"Amazon Alexa Service\" in your System settings, then your TV does not support Alexa.\n\nSample phrases:\n- \"Alexa, turn down the volume on [TV name].\"*\n- \"Alexa, set volume to 5 on [TV name].\"*\n- \"Alexa, mute [TV name].\"*\n- \"Alexa, fast forward.\"**\n- \"Alexa, pause.\"**\n- \"Alexa, play.\"**\n- \"Alexa, switch input to HDMI1.\"\n- \"Alexa, turn off [TV name].\"\n- \"Alexa, change channel to [Channel Number].\"\n- \"Alexa, change channel to [Channel Name].\"\n- \"Alexa, channel up on [TV name].\"\n- \"Alexa, start recording.\"***\n- \"Alexa, go to Home page.\"***\n- \"Alexa, go to Network settings.\"***\n- \"Alexa, move down.\"***\n- \"Alexa, search for comedy movies.\"***\n- \"Alexa, launch Prime Video.\"***\n\n*Volume control is applicable to external speakers connected to the TV only if the external speaker supports CEC and CEC is turned on.\n**Playback controls work on local media playback. For Apps, playback control varies based on Apps capabilities.\n***The availability for the functions marked with \"***\" varies based on TV models and TV locations.\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://voiceservice.vidaa.com/amazon-alexa/en_us\n\nTV Name:\nYou will be prompted to name your TV during the setup. Pick a unique name for every TV you set up. Use this name to tell Alexa which TV to control. You do not need to use the name every time you speak to Alexa. After the first time you ask Alexa to control your TV, Alexa will assume any applicable commands are for the same TV for the next 15 minutes. \nFor a TV with Alexa built-in, you don't need to specify the TV name if the TV that you are interacting with is the targeted TV.\n\nDownload our Remote Control App to interact with your TV by just using your voice.\nThis feature requires the Alexa built-in service, which varies based on TV models and locations where the TV is located.\n\n--- iOS version: https://apps.apple.com/app/remotenow/id1301866548\n--- Android version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.universal.remote.ms\n\nNOTE: Ensure your smart mobile device with Remote Control app and the TV to be controlled are connected to the same local network.\n\nIt\u2019s highly recommended to enable Alexa by following the instructions on your TV.\n\nIf you want to enable the Alexa Skill manually from the Alexa app and pair your TV with an external Alexa-enabled device (e.g. Echo), locate the Skill in the Alexa app and follow the instructions from the app. \n\nYou must link your VIDAA account with your Amazon Alexa account. Ensure you complete device pairing in the Alexa app, sign into your VIDAA account on the TV, then activate the Alexa service on the TV before using Alexa to control your TV.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
