Turn it on and off, launch games and apps, play and pause videos, and more, all from any Alexa-enabled device or Alexa apps on iOS and Android.\n\nTo get started, sign in to the Xbox console you want to control, tap \"Enable Skill\" in the Alexa app, and sign in with the Microsoft account you're using on that console. The Xbox you're signed in to will be automatically linked (you can also enable it on your console under Settings > Devices & connections > Digital assistants). To change the device name of your Xbox or add additional consoles to control, go to the Smart Home Devices section of the Alexa app.\n\nTo learn what the Xbox Skill can do, just say \"Alexa, ask Xbox what can I say\" Here are some commands to get you started.\n\nStandard commands\nFor access to all the commands available for the Xbox Skill on Alexa, use the standard command structure, like this:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to turn on.\" (Make sure instant on is enabled on your console.)\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to turn off.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to launch Forza Horizon 4\" (to turn on your console, sign in, and start the game).\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to pause\" (while a video is playing on Xbox).\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to resume.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to turn it up.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to turn volume down 5.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to record that.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, tell Xbox to start a party.\"\n\nNOTE: Both \"Tell Xbox\" and \"Ask Xbox\" work for standard commands.\n\nSmart home commands\nYou can also target Xbox consoles as a smart home device. Alexa smart home commands work for power, volume, and media controls. With smart home commands, you can drop the \"Tell Xbox\" or \"Ask Xbox\" portion, like in these examples:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on [device name].\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn off [device name].\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, pause on [device name].\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, resume on [device name].\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, volume up on [device name].\"\n\nThe default device name for Xbox consoles is \"Xbox\". Additional consoles have unique default names like \"Xbox 4B1D\". You can change the device name for smart home commands to something else - \"Basement Xbox\" or \"Den Xbox\" for example. This becomes especially important if you want to use Alexa with more than one Xbox. You can change the device name for your Xbox under Smart Home Devices in the Alexa mobile app.\n\nIf you've recently used your Xbox and there aren't any other smart home devices paired with Alexa, you can drop the device name altogether, like this:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, pause\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, play\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, resume\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, skip forward\"\n\nTV & video Skill commands\nA smaller set of video Skill commands are used for TV and game functions on Xbox. You can enable and manage video skills under Settings > TV & Video > Xbox in the Alexa app. Examples include:\n\u2022 \"Alexa, launch Forza Horizon 4.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, launch Forza Horizon 4 on Xbox.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, launch Netflix.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, launch Netflix on Xbox.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, record that.\"\n\nNOTE: Your Alexa device needs to be linked with your console via the TV & video setting to enable these TV & video Skill commands.\n\nGame Pass commands\n\u2022 \"Alexa, ask Xbox what's new on Xbox Game Pass?\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, ask Xbox what's popular on Xbox Game Pass?\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, ask Xbox what's leaving Xbox Game Pass?\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, ask Xbox is [game] on Xbox Game Pass?\"\n\nFor troubleshooting, including discovering your console and working with multiple consoles or users, see our support content and forums:\n\n\u2022 https://aka.ms/XboxSkillSupport\n\u2022 https://aka.ms/XboxRedditForum", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
