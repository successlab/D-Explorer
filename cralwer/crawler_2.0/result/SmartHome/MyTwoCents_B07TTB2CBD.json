Concerned about an issue and want your voice to be heard? Got a comment to make about a movie or a sports event you're watching? Whatever is on your mind, My Two Cents is here to help. It uses patented artificial intelligence to organize your comments with others on the same subject, and permits the subjects of those comments to hear what you say. All comments are completely anonymous; although we do ask for your general location (city and country) so posts can be organized geographically. Many brands and organizations value your feedback, and pose followup questions that may reward you with coupons or information via the Alexa app. We will also aggregate and periodically publish interesting analyses on subjects of interest. Let your voice be heard!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
