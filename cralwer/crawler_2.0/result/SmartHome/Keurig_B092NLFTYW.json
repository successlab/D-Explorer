You can even mention the size to brew 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces of your favorite beverage.\n\nJust say something like \"Alexa, ask Keurig to turn on my brewer\u201d, or \u201cAlexa, ask Keurig to brew me an eight ounce cup of coffee\", or \u201cAlexa, ask Keurig to brew over ice\u201d.\n\nYou can also use routines in the Alexa app to power on your brewer and start brewing a cup of coffee before getting out of bed. For example, configure the routine and then say \u201cAlexa, good morning\".", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
