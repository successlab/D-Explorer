You generate your API key in the admin tab of your SolarEdge online account. If you don't see an admin tab, ask your installer for admin rights.\n\nThere are 2 ways to enter your site id and API key for the skill:\n\n1) Go to the skill's data entry webpage and enter in your data. This is the easiest way!\n\nhttps://voice2biz.com/solaredgedataentry\n\n2) To enter the site id and API key from within the skill itself, you MUST use the Alexa App on your phone or tablet, and its KEYBOARD. If you don't see the Alexa keyboard icon in the Alexa App, you won't be able to use the skill. See our short YouTube video for a tutorial on how to enter them:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZAY2fRyPI\n\nIf your site id and API key don't seem to work, it might be because Alexa sometimes changes the data before it reaches the skill as it tries to interpret your input. \n\nIf you have trouble with entering your data, please contact me at solaredgeskill@gmail.com\n\nNote: This skill is NOT affiliated with SolarEdge Inc. (https://www.solaredge.com) The solar data is obtained from the SolarEdge API and requires the site id and API key of the target site.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
