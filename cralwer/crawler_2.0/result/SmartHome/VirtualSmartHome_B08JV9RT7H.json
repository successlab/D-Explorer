This skill may share device information with Amazon. Learn more.\nRated: Guidance Suggested. This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 13", "des": "NOTE: This skill requires an instance of Node-RED with the corresponding 'virtual-smart-home' package installed.\n\nIf you use Node-RED to automate stuff in your home, this skill is for you! It allows you to configure 'virtual device' nodes which can then be invoked through Alexa.\n\nFor example, you can set up a virtual switch, which triggers an action when you say \"Alexa, turn my virtual switch on\". When invoked, the node will emit a message object that you can route to any other node in your project, e.g. to actually do switch on a real device, or to post a tweet on Twitter, or do whatever you want...\n\nThe skill supports the following pre-configured virtual device types:\n\n- Switch\n- Plug\n- Dimmable Light Bulb\n- Color Changing Light Bulb\n- Dimmer Switch\n- Blinds\n- Fan\n- Thermostat\n- Scene\n\nTo be able to use this skill you need an installation of Node-RED including the 'virtual-smart-home' package which can be found and installed through the 'Palette Manager'. Afterwards you can select the 'virtual device' node from the palette and use it in your project.\n\nMore details can be found in the docs that are embedded in the help section of Node-RED.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
