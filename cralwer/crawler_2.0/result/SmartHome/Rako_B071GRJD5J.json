Simple, intuitive voice commands allow control of all Rako products via our new Cloud Gateway unit. This communicates with new or existing RA, WA, RTC or WTC-Bridges and allows complete control of your Rako system.\n \nThe Rako Skill supports the full home-automation feature set offered by Alexa, so that you can operate your lights, curtains, blinds and even water features, conveniently with a spoken command.\n \nBefore you start, test the operation of each room using the free Rako App, available for iOS, Android or Kindle tablets. The same information used by the App is used by the Cloud Gateway, so it\u2019s essential this is working before continuing.\n \nTo set-up Alexa control, first visit my.rakocontrols.com and register your Cloud Gateway using the unique code displayed on the unit. Then enable the Rako Skill within the Alexa App and click \u201cdiscover devices\u201d. You will now have a device for each room displayed on the Rako iOS or Android App. The device descriptions are the names you\u2019ll need to ask Alexa when controlling these rooms, for example Kitchen, All Rooms or Garden.\n \nFor further help configuring your system, please contact the Rako specialist who installed your system.
