To control multiple lights, shades, and temperature through a single voice command, just ask Alexa to turn on your favorite scene. Use the Lutron Connect App to select, update, and name your favorite devices or scenes for Alexa.\n\nFor your scenes, you can use the 'turn on' and 'turn off' commands to activate them. For example, you can say \"Turn on movie mode\" or \"Turn off living room\". For your dimmers, you can use the 'turn on', 'turn off', 'set to percent', 'dim', and 'brighten' commands to activate them. For example you can say \"Set the bedroom lights to 50 percent\" or \"Dim the kitchen\". For your shades, you can use the 'open', 'close', 'raise', 'lower' and 'set to percent' commands to activate them. For example, you can say \"Open the bedroom shades\".\n\nMore information is available in the Lutron Connect Alexa FAQ at http://tinyurl.com/connectalexa\n\n*NOTE \u2013 A Lutron Connect Bridge linked to a Lutron account is required for Alexa to work with RadioRA2 and HomeWorks QS systems. For best performance, version 10.6 or higher of RadioRA2 or HomeWorks QS system software required.
