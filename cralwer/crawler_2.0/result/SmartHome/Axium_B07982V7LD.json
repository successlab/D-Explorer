This includes standby, mute, volume, source selection, and playback control.\n\nThe Alexa integration is managed by the Media Manager (AMM), the supplementary media streaming device providing additional media services and functionality to an Axium audio system.\n\nThis skill requires account linking. In addition to the account linking in the skill, the AMM needs to be associated with the account as well. This is done on the Services config webpage available at the '/config' endpoint. ie: 'http://amm123.local/config', where 'amm123' is the network name of the AMM.\nThis process creates a secure association between the Alexa user account and the AMM, allowing for control of the system. An Alexa account can be linked to any number of AMM's, and an AMM can be linked to any number of Alexa accounts. This allows for shared usage in a household or workplace where members may each have their own account. It also means that an Alexa user can have voice control of numerous Axium systems - such as at home or the office. This is provided that the zones in each system are distinctly named, just as with any other smart home appliance.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
