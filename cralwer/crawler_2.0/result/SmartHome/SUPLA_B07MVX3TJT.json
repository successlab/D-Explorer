It allows you to control home and office equipment using executive devices offered by professional suppliers, as well as through amateur solutions based on platforms such as Raspberry PI, Arduino or electronics based on micro chips from the ESP8266 family. This extension allows you to expand the skills of Alex's voice assistant by enabling voice commands of devices that are connected to your account in a public or private Cloud.\n\nTo use this Skill you must have an account on cloud.supla.org.\n\n----\nIf you want to use ready-made executive devices, you can buy the equipment offered by the following suppliers.\n \nhttps://zamel.com/en-GB/products/supla-wifi-control\nhttps://nice.pl\n \nOtherwise you can build executive devices by yourself.\n---- \nShort manual how to run the Arduino-based executive device.\n \n1. Download SuplaDevice library for Arduino\nhttps://www.supla.org/download/ArduinoSuplaDevice.zip\n2. Run Arduino IDE\n3. Click Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP Library\n4. Open one of the examples. File -> Examples -> SuplaDevice\n5. Complete the code (GUID, Server, Location ID, Location Password)\n6. Upload the program to Arduino\n \n----\nShort manual how to run a self-made executive device based on ESP8266 microcontroller:\n \n1. Download and flash Firmware for the microcontroller\nhttps://www.supla.org/download\n2. Turn the device on\n3. Press and hold the CFG button for 5 sec. (Default GPIO2)\n4. Connect the computer to WiFi called SUPLA-ESP8266\n5. Go to http://192.168.4.1\n6. Enter your email address\n7. Enter access data to your WiFi\n8. Click \"Save\"\n10. Restart the device or press the CFG button\n \n----\nShort manual how to connect your Raspberrry PI microcomputer to Supla:\n \n1.
