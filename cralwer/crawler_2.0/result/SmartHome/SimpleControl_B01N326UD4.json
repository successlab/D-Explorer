To get started, select the \u2018Enable Skill\u2019 button in the Alexa App to link your Simple Control account and discover your devices. Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home\n\nRequires Simple Control for iOS with active Simple Service, and licensed Simple Hub software for iOS, macOS or tvOS. Simple Control must be paired with Simple Hub, signed in to your Simple Control account, and Simple Hub must be running in order to accept commands. See the Simple Control knowledge base for listings of example phrases and usage instructions.\n\nSimple Control provides two Alexa skills: a Custom Skill and a Smart Home Skill (this skill). We recommend adding both for full functionality. This Smart Home skill provides many convenient ways to address Activities, Devices, and Rooms without an initial \"tell Simple Control\" prefix. The Custom Skill provides more detailed commands. Both require active Simple Service and Simple Hub running on your iOS, macOS, or tvOS device.\n\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which device to use. There are two ways to define these names:\n\u2022 Use the names you set up already \u2013 these are shown in the Simple Control app and can be changed, or\n\u2022 Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information is available at http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your devices, you can say the following:\n\nAlexa, turn on the Living Room. (launch first activity with an opening device in the Living Room)\nAlexa, turn on Office DISH. (open \u201cWatch DISH\u201d in the Office)\nAlexa, turn on Living Room TiVo. (open \u201cWatch TiVo\u201d in the Living Room)\nAlexa, set the Bedroom Receiver to 25%. (set volume to -55.5 dB for Denon Receiver in the Bedroom)\nAlexa, set Kitchen Sonos to 60.
