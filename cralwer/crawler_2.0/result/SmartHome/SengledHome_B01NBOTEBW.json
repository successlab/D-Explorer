For Sengled bulbs supporting tunable whites, you can make the bulb color warmer or cooler. \n \nPlease read \"Using Amazon Alexa with your Sengled bulbs\" at \nhttps://support.sengled.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024959353-Setting-up-the-devices-on-your-Sengled-Home-app-to-work-with-your-Amazon-Echo-Alexa-device-s- on how to setup Alexa to use the Sengled Home skill. \n \nAfter logging into your Sengled account through Alexa, simply tell Alexa to search for your Sengled devices by saying \"Alexa, discover my devices.\"\n \nYou may control groups or individual bulbs. Alexa does not automatically import your scenes from the Sengled Home app. However, using the group functionality in the Alexa app, simply add the same bulbs to the group in order to create the similar functionality.\n \nYou may need to rename your bulbs in the Sengled Home app for Alexa to properly recognize them. After renaming the bulbs in the Sengled Home app, ask Alexa to rediscover your devices.\n \nAfter naming and discovering your Sengled devices, you can turn them on and off and adjust the brightness level. For example, if you have a device named Desk Lamp or a group named Bedroom, you can say things like:\n \n\"Alexa, turn on the Desk Lamp\u201d\n\"Alexa, turn off the Desk Lamp\u201d\n\"Alexa, set the Bedroom to 50%\u201d\n\"Alexa, brighten the Bedroom\u201d\n\"Alexa, dim the Desk Lamp\"\n \nFor Sengled bulbs that support tunable whites, like Sengled Plus, you can also tune the shades of white by saying things like:\n \n\u201cAlexa, make the Bedroom warmer\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, make the Desk Lamp cooler\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, set the Bedroom to incandescent\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, set the Desk Lamp to daylight\u201d\n \n \nEnjoy your new Sengled Devices!
