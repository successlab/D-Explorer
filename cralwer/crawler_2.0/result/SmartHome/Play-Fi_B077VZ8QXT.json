Enjoy music, radio, and talk shows on the premium home audio equipment from the biggest names in audio at the command of your voice. Turn the volume up, change up what's playing, and command your whole home audio without having to open an app.\n\nOnce you've linked your Amazon account to your compatible DTS Play-Fi products, you can use Alexa-enabled assistants like the Phorus PS10 Smart Speaker, Amazon Echo or Dot, etc., to request playback on that Play-Fi product by name. Just ask for your favorite music to play \"in the Living Room\" or \"on Patio\" for example, and Alexa will automatically pull it from Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, or TuneIn, with more streaming services coming soon.\n\nCurrently, playing to groups isn't supported by voice command, but you can use the Play-Fi app to configure groups once you've started playing.\n\nThis skill is rolling out now to DTS Play-Fi partners and their products. To find out if your products are supported, or when they're getting the update, please reach out to your brand's support group, and they can help.\nCheck out our general DTS Play-Fi knowledge base here if you have a general question:\nhttps://play-fi.com/faq\nLastly, you can also contact us directly with questions of any kind at this e-mail address:\nsupport@play-fi.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
