To get started, download the Bose Music app and link your Amazon account.

Once music is playing, you can also control the experience by voice. For example:\n\n\u201cAlexa, next track.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, previous track.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, what is playing?\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, stop.\u201d\n\nCurrently you can play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, SiriusXM, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. Make sure to link your accounts for these music services in the Alexa app.\n\nThe skill is compatible with all Bose products that have integrated microphones.
