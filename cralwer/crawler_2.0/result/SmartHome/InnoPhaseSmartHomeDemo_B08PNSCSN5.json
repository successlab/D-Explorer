In the Alexa App, search for the \u201cInnoPhase Smart Home Demo\u201d Skill.\n\n(2). Click on \u201cEnable skill\u201d and you'll be navigated to \u2018Login With Amazon\u2019 login page to link your account to the Skill.\n\n(3). Input your email id and password associated with the Amazon account, allow the permissions, and you'll be redirect to the success page saying \u201cInnoPhase Smart Home Demo\u201d has been successfully linked\u201d.\n\n(4). After successfully linking the Skill as per previous step, please email the email-id associated with your Amazon Account to \u2018cloud-dev@innophaseinc.com\u2019 with the subject line -\u2018request for device creation, device specific elf binary and info\u2019, and wait for a reply email.\nFor emailing this info, any other email-id (other than the email associated with the Amazon) also can be used.\n\n(5). Sometime later, a virtual device named 'Inno Switch' will be created for you in InnoPhase Inc's AWS IoT Core Service. You will get a notification in your Alexa App and an email when the device \u2018Inno Switch\u2019 is created.\n\n(6). After you get the notification, you can find this device under section Devices/Switches section in Alexa App. Now the setup is complete and you can start controlling them using Alexa.\n\n(7). At this stage, users can discover this device and switch on / switch off using the Alexa app UI in Devices/Switches section OR it can be controlled using voice interaction with Alexa. \nThis virtual device can be controlled even if you don\u2019t have the evaluation board.\nFollowing voice interactions can be used.\n\"Alexa, turn on Inno Switch\"\n\"Alexa, turn off Inno Switch\"\n\n(8). If you have access to Talaria TWO Module Evaluation Boards (INP3010/INP3011), then you can follow the details given in mail you received in step 4, on how to program it for working with the Skill. Once programmed, you can see the effect of control commands via the LED in the EVB being controlled when interacting with \u201cInno Switch\u201d device.\n\nThis Skill helps our customers who are evaluating our hardware platform for their business needs, to see a demonstration of our SDK\u2019s and Platform's capability to be controlled using Amazon Alexa and evaluate the power consumption of the hardware solution over time while being connected to AWS IoT Core Service Cloud.\n\n\n--------\nDetails about Talaria TWO Module Evaluation Boards, programming tools, SDK and how to purchase them is provided below.\n\nAbout InnoPhase Talaria TWO based integrated wireless IoT connectivity solutions \u2013\n\nThe new INP1010/INP1011 products from InnoPhase are complete solutions with integrated wireless connectivity plus microcontroller for edge-of-network IoT designs.
