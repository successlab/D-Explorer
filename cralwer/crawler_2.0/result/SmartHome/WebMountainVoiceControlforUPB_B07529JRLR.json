This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "This skill works with the Web Mountain Remote Universal Controller (RUC-02) for voice control of lighting and appliances using Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) automation devices such as the SW-7 wall dimmer. UPB uses programming and monitoring software called Upstart to configure devices for proper operation. Upstart provides an Export file, with the file extension UPE, that provides all necessary details for control of a UPB network. The user will upload this UPE file to the RUC-02. This file is what provides the necessary information for the Alexa capability. The skill will query the RUC-02 unit and discover the devices in the UPB network from this information. So, in order to use this skill, you need a RUC unit, any number of UPB devices, and you must use Upstart to create a UPE file and transfer it to the RUC unit. Before you can use the RUC with the skill, you must contact Web Mountain to register your account.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
