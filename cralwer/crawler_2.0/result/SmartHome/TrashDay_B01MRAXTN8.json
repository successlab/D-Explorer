Is my trash pickup is Monday/Thursday or is it Tuesday/Friday? And the recycling and lawn waste pickups happen on different days. And some days I'm not sure if today is Tuesday or Wednesday anyway. Alexa, help me!\n\nUse Trash Day to teach Alexa your regular pickup schedule. Here is mine:\n \"Alexa, open Trash Day.\"\n \"Set time zone to Eastern.\"\n \"Add weekly trash pickup on Tuesday at six a.m.\"\n \"Add weekly trash pickup on Friday at six a.m.\"\n \"Add biweekly recycling pickup on this Wednesday at one a.m.\"\n \"Add biweekly lawn waste pickup on Wednesday after next at one p.m.\"\n \"Add monthly scrap metal pickup on the fifteenth at four p.m.\"\n \"Stop\"\n\nThen, whenever you aren't sure if the trash needs to go out to the curb:\n \"Alexa, open Trash Day.\"\n \"Alexa, ask Trash Day, is it trash day?\"\n \"Alexa, tell Trash Day, to tell me the schedule.\"\n\nFor more extensive help, refer to the documentation at: https://s3.amazonaws.com/trash-day-docs/Help.html", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
