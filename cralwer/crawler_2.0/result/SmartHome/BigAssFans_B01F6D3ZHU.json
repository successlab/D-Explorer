This account is usually created when you first connect a Big Ass Fans device to your home wireless network.*\n\nTo get started, select the 'Enable' button above and log in. Authorize the link to the Big Ass Fans account that is associated with your fan or light, and then say \u201cAlexa, discover devices.\u201d For more details on enabling an Alexa skill, please see https://www.amazon.com/help/alexa/smarthome/add-device.\n\nYou can use Alexa to:\n\nTurn fans or lights on or off. For example, \u201cAlexa, turn on Bedroom fan.\u201d\nChange fan speed. For example, \u201cAlexa, increase Dining Room fan speed\u201d or \u201cAlexa, set Dining Room fan to 10%.\u201d\nChange light brightness. For example, \u201cAlexa, set Library light to 85%\u201d or \u201cAlexa, make Library light brighter.\u201d\n\nPro tip: you can use Alexa to create smart home device groups that control multiple devices. For example, add the fans and lights in your theater, downstairs bar, and recreation rooms to an Alexa group named \u201cBasement.\u201d Say \u201cAlexa, set Basement lights to 60%,\" and your entire downstairs dims the lights for family movie time! For instructions on how to set up a smart home device group, refer to https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201749250.\n\n* If you did not create an account when first setting up your device, launch your fan's app and open the menu; tap where it says \u201cNot Signed In\u201d and you will be prompted to create or sign into an account.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
