In order to use Alexa to voice-activate your PowerView\u00ae Scenes, you will need a Gen2 PowerView\u00ae Hub (the round, white one) and that hub must be registered to the PowerView account you are linking to. If you don't have a Gen2 PowerView Hub, please visit an authorized Hunter Douglas dealer to learn more.\n\nPowerView\u00ae Motorization merges seamlessly with Alexa to bring enhanced operation of popular Hunter Douglas window coverings to your connected lifestyle. \n \nPowerView\u00ae works with Alexa to allow you to voice-activate your favorite PowerView\u00ae Scenes created in the PowerView\u00ae App.\n\nOnce you have designated the Scenes you want to operate with Alexa, simply speak \u201cAlexa, turn on\u201d followed by the PowerView Scene name to activate the Scene.\n\nSample Voice-Commands:\n\"Alexa, turn on Good Morning\"\n\"Alexa, turn on I'm Home\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Good Night\"\n\nIf you have multiple Scenes with the same name, but in different Rooms, simply speak \"Alexa, turn on\" followed by the PowerView Scene name AND Room name, like so:\n\nSample Voice-Commands:\n\"Alexa, turn on Good Morning in the Bedroom\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Good Night in the Living Room\"\n\nBelow are some tips for success when voice-activating your PowerView Scenes:\n* After performing a Discover, your PowerView Scenes will be located in Scenes in your Smart Home. This is accessed through the Alexa App Menu by selecting Smart Home then Scenes.\n* Make your Scene names easy to pronounce\n* Do not name a Scene \"Off\"\n* When possible, give Scenes unique names\n* If you utter a Scene name that is used in multiple Rooms, without identifying the Room, Alexa will respond \"A few things share that name, which one did you want?\" You can respond to Alexa with \"in the <Room name>\", such as \"in the Bedroom\" or \"in the Living Room\" to activate the Scene in that room.\n* Use Groups to combine multiple PowerView Scenes as well as Scenes from other devices for whole-home automation\n\nIn order to use Alexa with your PowerView\u00ae shades, you'll need the following:\n\nHardware Requirements: PowerView\u00ae Hub Gen 2 and at least one PowerView shade\nAccount Requirements: PowerView\u00ae Account with a registered PowerView Hub (account setup and hub registration in the PowerView app). This ensures seamless account linking with the Alexa app. \n\nFor more information on Hunter Douglas PowerView\u00ae Motorization products visit: www.hunterdouglas.com/operating-systems/powerview-motorization", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
