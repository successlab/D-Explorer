This skill contains: dynamic content.\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 6", "des": "To use this skill you need to first setup the Alexa client service on your Philips Smart TV. Start the setup by launching the \"Amazon Alexa\" app from the Home screen of your TV. Follow the instructions and complete the following steps:\n- Select a name for your Smart TV for Alexa to recognise it.\n- Select a Google account and sign-in. \n- Return to this skill in the Alexa App on your phone to enable it, link accounts, and discover your devices. \n- Return to your TV to complete setup. \n\n1. SUPPORTED MODELS\nPhilips Smart TV models that support this skill will have the \"Amazon Alexa\" client app on the Home screen. You don't need to manually install this app on your TV, it will be automatically available on supported TVs. Make sure your TV is connected to the Internet and has the latest software version. If the app is not on the Home screen, your TV may not be supporting this feature yet.\n\n2. TV NAME\nUse the TV name to tell Alexa which device to control. Pick a unique name for every TV you set up. For example: \u201cTV\u201d, \u201cLiving Room TV\u201d, \u201cMedia Room TV\u201d etc.\n\n3. VOICE CONTROL\nYou don't need to use the TV\u2019s name every time you speak to Alexa. First time you ask Alexa to control your Philips Smart TV using the TV name, Alexa will assume any applicable commands should control the same TV for a period of time. If you want to move away from controlling your TV, just ask Alexa to do an Alexa-specific activity. For example, ask her to play a song.\n\nYou can use the following Amazon Alexa voice commands to control your Smart TV:\n\nSWITCH TV ON/OFF (see note below)\n\"Alexa, turn on Living Room TV.\"\n\"Alexa, turn off TV.\"\n\nNOTE: Switching TV On/Off will work only if the Alexa Switch on/off setting is enabled in the TV via the Amazon Alexa app.\n\nCHANGE CHANNEL\n\"Alexa, next channel on TV.\"\n\"Alexa, change channel to 5 on TV.\"\n\"Alexa, channel down on Living Room TV.\"\n\nCHANGE VOLUME\n\"Alexa, set volume to 15 on Living Room TV.\"\n\"Alexa, turn down the volume.\"\n\"Alexa, volume up.\"\n\nMUTE OR UNMUTE TV\n\"Alexa, mute Living Room TV.\"\n\"Alexa, unmute.\"\n\nCHANGE INPUT SOURCE\n\"Alexa, switch input to Blu-ray on Living Room TV.\"\n\"Alexa, switch input to HDMI 1.\"\n\nCONTROL PLAYBACK\n\"Alexa, play on TV.\"\n\"Alexa, pause TV.\"\n\"Alexa, fast forward.\"\n\"Alexa, rewind.\"\n\nCONTROL AMBILIGHT (Note: The supported Ambilight styles may depend on specific TV models.\nPlease refer the user manual of your TV to know the supported Ambilight styles)\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight.\"\n\"Alexa, turn off Ambilight.\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Follow colour.\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Follow video.\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Follow audio.\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Follow flag.\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Lounge light.\"\n\n\u201cAlexa, turn on Ambilight on Living Room TV\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn off Ambilight on Living Room TV\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn on Ambilight Follow video on Living Room TV\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn on Ambilight Follow audio on Living Room TV\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn on Ambilight Follow colour on Living Room TV\u201d\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Follow flag on Living Room TV\"\n\"Alexa, turn on Ambilight Lounge light on Living Room TV\"\n\nThis is an example sequence of a possible conversation with Alexa:\nYou say, \u201cAlexa, turn on TV.\u201d\nAlexa says, \u201cOkay\u201d and the TV powers ON.\nYou say, \"Alexa, change channel to 5.\"\nAlexa says, \"Okay\" and the TV tunes to channel 5.\nYou say, \u201cAlexa, turn up the volume.\u201d\nAlexa says, \u201cOkay\u201d and the TV volume goes up.\nYou say, \u201cAlexa, play Beat-it.\u201d\nAlexa says, \u201cOkay\u201d and plays Beat-it on the Echo device.\nYou say, \u201cAlexa, turn up the volume.\u201d\nAlexa says, \u201cOkay\u201d and the volume on the Echo device goes up.\n\nSUPPORTED LANGUAGES\nEnglish (GB), English (AU), German, Spanish, French, English(US), English(IN), Hindi, Spanish(US), Portugese(BR)\n\nYou can select the skill language in your Echo device settings.\n\n4.
