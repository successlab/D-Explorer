You can request status updates about your home\u2019s Presence connected devices and send commands to your home security system, smart plugs, lights or even your connected thermostat. This skill expands on the Presence Smart Home skill to let you incorporate additional functionality like controlling your Presence cameras and monitoring your sensors.\n\nBefore you begin:\nYou will need a Presence account. Visit http://presencepro.com to find out more about our free service. Once you've created your account, you can enable this skill. You will need to log into your Presence account to link it to Alexa.\n\nTo get started:\nYou can use a spare iOS and Android device as a free Presence security camera and ask Alexa to take a picture on command (coming soon to Android). You can always choose to expand the functionality of your Presence system by purchasing a Presence Security Pack and any of the following supported sensors from our online store:\n- Presence Entry Sensor\n- Presence Water Sensor\n- Presence Touch Sensor\n- Presence Motion Detector\n- Presence Temperature Sensor\n- Presence Humidity Sensor\n- Presence Smart Plug\n- Presence Thermostat \nVisit http://presencepro.com/store/ for more information.\n\nNext steps:\nAfter you've set up your environment, you can begin monitoring and controlling all of your connected devices. Here are some examples of what you can say:\n- \"Alexa, ask Presence for help.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Presence for the status of my devices.\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Presence to take my picture.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to turn on my lights.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to turn off my outlets.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to brighten my living room.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to dim my lights.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to set my office light to 50%.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to set my thermostat to cool.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to increase my thermostat.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to decrease my thermostat.\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Presence to set my thermostat to 70 degrees.\u201d\n\nTips: The Presence skill is designed to be intuitive. But to help you along, here are some cool features you may not have known about.\n\nGrouping Devices: \nBy default, the Presence skill automatically groups all your devices by their type, like \"lights\", \"plugs\", \"doors\", etc. In addition, you can create custom groups of devices easily using our iOS, Android, or web Presence apps. To create groups of devices, rename your device to include one of many possible predefined zone/room names. For example, here's how one might name their devices to create groups of devices in their living room:\n- \"Living room overhead light 1\"\n- \"Living room overhead light 2\"\n- \"Living room camera\"\n- \"Living room temperature sensor\"\n- \"Living room motion detector\"\n\nGroups are stackable too. You can have any device associated with any number of groups. For example, the first two devices are associated with both the \"first floor\" and the \"bathroom\" groups while the second two devices are associated with both the \"second floor\" and the \"bathroom\" groups:\n- \"First floor bathroom light\"\n- \"First floor bathroom smart plug\"\n- \"Second floor bathroom light\"\n- \"Second floor bathroom smart plug\"\n\nHere are some common groups that you can begin using today:\n- Living room\n- Kitchen\n- Bedroom\n- Hallway\n- Outside\n- Garage\n- Office\n- Whole home\n\nCheck out our companion website below for more groups. If you find a zone or room that our Presence skill does not yet know, we would love to hear about it so we can teach our skill a new trick.\n\nProviding feedback:\nWe believe in building features you want. If you think of a new feature you would like us to build, let us know. You can provide feedback directly to our engineers through any of our iOS, Android, or web based Presence apps. To find out how, use Alexa. Say \"Alexa, ask Presence about suggestions.\"\n\nFor more information about this skill, visit http://www.presencepro.com/presence-alexa-skills", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
