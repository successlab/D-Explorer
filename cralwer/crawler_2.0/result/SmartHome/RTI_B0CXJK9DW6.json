Adjust the lights, set the thermostat, play music throughout the home, fire up the home theater and more. With simple and intuitive voice commands, you can activate \"smart scenes\" to control groups of devices.\n\nAn RTI system running RTI Integration Designer software version 11.6 or higher is required to work with this skill. Please contact your authorized RTI Smart Control Pro to learn more. Your RTI dealer will enable Alexa within Integration Designer, and then give you a link to authorize Alexa on the RTI dashboard, unlocking Alexa voice control convenience for your system.\n\nThe RTI Control Skill supports the full set of Alexa voice commands for controlling lighting, climate, audio/video devices, television, and more, plus multiple-event scenes. Let's look at a few examples:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on the Living Room lights\" sets all lights configured in the Living Room to 100%.\n\u2022 \"Alexa, set the Living Room lights to 50%\" adjusts all lights configured in the Living Room to 50%. For some lights this could mean turning them on; while for others, turning them down, all from the same voice command.\n\u2022 \"Alexa, lower the Office shades\" lowers the shades in the Office to their full lowest position.\n\u2022 \"Alexa, set Office shades to half\" will either raise or lower the shades in the Office until they are at the 50% (half-way) position.\n\nMultiple Event Scenes can be turned on in the same manner by saying \"Alexa, turn on 'Scene Name'\" For example:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on Movie Time\" sets the media room lights, turn on the TV monitor, adjusts the volume, and launches your favorite streaming service. \n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on Patio Dinner\" set the perfect patio lighting and send your favorite dinner music to the patio speakers.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
