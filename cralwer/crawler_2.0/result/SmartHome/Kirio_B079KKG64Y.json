Additionally, make sure you are already paired with Kirio and received access from your Master user.\nIf you have multiple Kirio homes, before proceeding with account linking, open the home you'd like to link with Alexa first.\nThe mobile device used to start the linking must have the Alexa and Kirio apps installed.\nOnce your account is linked, all voice commands given to Alexa will appear as if coming from the Kirio app. The authorization for the Kirio user must allow Full Access in order for Alexa to send commands from the Internet. \nFinally, the user access rights for rooms and device controls will be enforced when Alexa sends commands.\nAfter creating new scenarios, please ask Alexa to \"Discover devices\" for you Kirio scenarios to be available.\nSince Kirio knows the rooms where your devices are, whenever you have multiple devices which share the same name, add the \"in\" for a room (e.g. turn on the switch IN the living room).\nPlease visit https://support.mykirio.com/kirio-alexa-voice-control for additional help.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
