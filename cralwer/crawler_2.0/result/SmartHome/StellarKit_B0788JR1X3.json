To get started:\n* Select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App.\n* Follow the instructions in your Stellar Kit app to get your Stellar account linked to your Amazon account.\n* Let Alexa get your Stellar Kit devices by saying \"Alexa, discover devices\".\nFind more information about connecting smart home devices at Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home).\n\nWhen using the skill, you need established names for your devices. There are two ways to define these names:\n* Use the names you previously set up. They are shown in the Stellar Kit app and can be changed.\n* Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information is available at Create a Smart Home Device Group (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups).\n\nNotes:\n* This skill uses \"Login With Amazon\" for account linking.\n* Groups set in the Stellar Kit app are also added as devices to your Alexa. You can control them by saying \"Alexa, turn on kitchen bulbs\".\n* If Alexa replies \"The hub the device [name] connected to is not responding\", it means that the Stellar Kit gateway is offline. Please check its network and power supply.\n* If you have any questions or suggestions, contact us at service@sansitech.us", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
