To get started, create a Luke Roberts Cloud account in the Luke Roberts app under the settings menu of one of your connected lamps. This will enable the Cloud Bridging feature and for your lamps. Then select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App to link your Luke Roberts Cloud account and discover your smart lamps. You can find a detailed tutorial on our Luke Roberts support pages (https://tinyurl.com/lrhowto-alexa-connect). Find more information about connecting smart home devices at Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home).\n\nWhen using the skill, you need established names for your smart lamps. There are two ways to define these names:\n- Use the lamp names you previously set up. They are shown in the Luke Roberts app and can be changed in the lamps settings menu.\n- Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Kitchen, and add the smart lamps to the group. More information is available at Create a Smart Home Device Group (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups).\n\nUsing the lamp name or group name, you can say the following:\n- \"Alexa, turn on Bedroom\" to switch on the lamp. If the lamp is already on, the lamp will activate the next light scene.\n- \"Alexa, set Kitchen to 50%\" or \"Alexa, dim Kitchen\" to adjust the brightness of the current light scene.\n- \"Alexa, set Bedroom to red\" or \"Alexa, set Kitchen to warm\" to modify the color of the current light scene.\n\nFurthermore, it is possible to select a configured scene on a lamp. You need to say the activation phrase beforehand. See the following examples:\n- \u201eAlexa, ask Luke Roberts to select scene cooking on kitchen\"\n- \u201eAlexa, ask Luke Roberts to activate reading on couch\"\n- \u201eAlexa, ask Luke Roberts to activate dinner on living room\"\n\nUsing this skill to change the lamp's active light scene in brightness or color will not affect the original light scene saved in the lamp. Activating the original light scene again from the Luke Roberts app or using the switch will restore the original setting.\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit the Luke Roberts Voice Assistant FAQ at the Luke Roberts Support Page (https://support.luke-roberts.com).", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
