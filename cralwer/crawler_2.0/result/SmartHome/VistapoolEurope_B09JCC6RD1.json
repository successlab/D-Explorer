These include the current PH value, chlorine and / or oxidation, and the filtration and lighting state and mode. (if the pool includes these capabilities).\n\nA brief of things you can ask to Alexa to carry out maintenance on your pool:\n- \"What is the temperature of the water?\"\n- \"What is the chlorine level?\"\n- \"Turn on the filtration\"\n- \"Set the PH level to seven\"\n...\n\nIn order to manage your pool throught the Alexa assistant, we must first identify with your Vistapool Europe account. Therefore, the first time you use the skill, we will ask you to enter the credentials (username and password) that you normally use to access it from the website or mobile application. Keep in mind that you can always unlink your Vistapool account with the skill from the preferences panel inside the Alexa application.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
