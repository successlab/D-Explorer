This skill may share device information with Amazon. Learn more.\nRated: Guidance Suggested. This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 6", "des": "The Project Nursery Video skill is for streaming your Project Nursery Smart Wi-Fi Baby Monitor (Model #PNMAL2 and #PNMSA2) directly to your Amazon Echo Video Devices (Echo Show/Echo Spot/Fire TV).  This skill is for streaming only and is different than the Project Nursery Alexa skill, which you can use your voice to control the camera like asking what the temperature is or to play a lullaby. \n \nUsing the Project Nursery Video skill, users will be able to stream up to 10 minutes at a time before the stream automatically times out and will be able to stream up to a total of 1 hour per day. The 1 hour of streaming/day time period resets automatically every 24 hours, based on the time that you first started streaming. \n \nRequirements for the streaming feature to work:\n-Own an Alexa Video device (Echo Show/Echo Spot/Fire TV)\n-Own a Project Nursery Smart Wi-Fi Baby Monitor (model # PNMAL2)\n-PNMAL2 camera firmware needs to be updated to version 362 or the latest higher version (when viewing camera on app, go to settings>Camera Information.  There will be a red dot next to system firmware, if an update is available.) \n-Enable the Project Nursery Video Alexa Skill (login info is same as your Smart Camera app login)\n \nTo enable this feature, your camera and your Alexa video device must be connected to Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz) for the video stream to work.  In the Amazon Alexa App, search in the skills section for Project Nursery Video (this is a different skill than the original Project Nursery Alexa Skill) and enable the skill.  The prompt asks you to log in using your Smart Camera app login info (NOT your Amazon Alexa login info!). \nAfter you enable the skill, the Alexa App will ask you to \u201cDiscover Devices\u201d. \u201cDiscover Devices\u201d searches your home for smart home devices like the Smart Camera that have their skills enabled in your Alexa account.  Please make sure camera is turned on and connected to the Wi-Fi network. After \u201cDiscover Devices\u201d is complete, search in the Alexa app for Smart Home->Devices section to make sure your camera is listed in the devices.  The camera name will be the same as what you entered when you paired the camera to the network in the Project Nursery Smart Camera app.  Simply Say \u201cAlexa, show me the {Camera name} camera\u201d to pull up the live video on your Alexa Video Device.  Say \u201cAlexa, stop video\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Exit\u201d to end stream.\n \nTroubleshooting:\nIf you have trouble getting the camera to stream, check the following details:\n-Your camera and the Alexa Video Device should be on the same Wi-Fi network (2.4 GHz)\n-You have the correct Project Nursery camera.  Check camera rating label for Model: PNMAL2\n-You are selecting the correct Alexa skill: Project Nursery Video\n-You are using your smart camera app login when enabling the Project Nursery Video Alexa Skill\n-You have done \u201cdiscover devices\u201d and checked that your camera shows up in the \u201cSmart Home section>Devices\u201d section\n-You have not already streamed more than 1 hour of live video to your Alexa device that day\n-Your camera name is something that Alexa can recognize.  We suggest using one of our default camera names.  You can change the camera name in the Project Nursery Smart Camera in the cameras settings.  Be sure to \u201cdiscover devices\u201d again after changing the camera name!\n\nIf you have checked that all of the conditions above are true, try disabling and re-enabling the Alexa skill. If you continue to have issues, please contact customer support at (844)393-7338 or electronics@projectnursery.com. ", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
