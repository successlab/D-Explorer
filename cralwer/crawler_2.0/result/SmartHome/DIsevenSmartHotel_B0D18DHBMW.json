To get started, select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App to link your Diseven account and discover your devices. Find more information about connecting smart home devices at Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa.\n\nSteps to link accounts with Diseven:\n1. Purchase your Diseven (Dimaster) device and connect it to your Local network with Internet access.\n2. Validate and link the email associated with your Amazon profile on the Diseven (Dimaster) device. This is done by entering the web page generated by this device ('Dimaster') within your local network.\n3. Once your email has been validated, use it to log in with the Diseven Technological Innovation skill.\n4. Search for your devices (Alexa, discover devices).\n\nWhen using the skill, you need established names for your devices. There are two ways to define these names:\n\u2022 Use the names that you previously configured in the \u2018Dimaster\u2019 of the Diseven system. They are shown in the web interface of the Dimaster connected to your local network (In the Adding Devices section) and can be changed. You must be connected directly to the same local network as the Dimaster to view this web interface. \n\u2022 Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information is available at Create a Smart Home Device Group (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups)\nOnce you know the name or group name for your devices, you can say the following:\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on the bedroom.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn off the kitchen.\"\n\nCurrently, the support includes lights and switches.\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit the Diseven system page at https://diseven.com.co", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
