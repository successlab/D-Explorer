The multi-protocol hub connects different types of objects (lamps, sockets, shutters, thermostats), different protocols and brands. The Otodo one application allows you to name these objects and assign them a location. \nThanks to Alexa, the user orders the objects that are connected to the Otodo hub, and runs the scenarios including these objects, all in accordance with the context of the house described through the Otodo application.\nThis context is transferred to Alexa, once the Otodo skill has been downloaded and initialized with the login/password of the Otodo account.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
