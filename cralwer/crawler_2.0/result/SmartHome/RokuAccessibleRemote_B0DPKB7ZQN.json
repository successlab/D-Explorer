The ESP32 acts as a bridge between Alexa and your Roku TV, subscribing to voice commands through AWS IoT and translating them into Roku\u2019s ECP (External Control Protocol) commands. With this skill, you can turn your TV on or off, navigate the interface, adjust the volume, and launch apps like Netflix or Hulu effortlessly. The ESP32 is designed for dynamic functionality, including automatic network configuration through an easy-to-use web interface and local discovery of the Roku TV. This ensures an adaptable and user-friendly setup, enabling hands-free control of your entertainment system.\n\nRequirements: This skill requires an active Wi-Fi connection, an ESP32 device with the included software pre-installed, and a Roku TV configured to allow ECP commands. Additionally, the user must link their Alexa and AWS IoT accounts to enable functionality.\n\nThis project, developed as part of a University of Ottawa MakerRepo initiative, was specifically designed for an impaired client named Kyle to provide a tailored solution for enhanced accessibility and independence.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
