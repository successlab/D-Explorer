This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: robomow", "reviewnum": " 3", "des": "Along with our existing digital innovations (the Robomow mobile app and the MyRobomow web application) we're now happy to introduce the Robomow skill!\n\nIf your Robomow robotic mower is fitted with a GSM module, this skill will allow you to perform the following actions via a simple voice command:\n@ Start a mowing operation \n@ Stop an operation and send the mower back to the Base Station\n@ Check mower's status\n@ Check when and how was mower's last operation\n@ Check the next departure time of the mower\n@ Enable and disable an automatic scheduled departure \n\n\nHOW TO GET STARTED:\n1) Create your Robomow account by registering in the Robomow mobile app or in the MyRobomow web application (www.robomow.com/en-GB/myrobomow/). If you're already registered with Robomow, then skip this step\n2) Enable Robomow skill on your Amazon Echo or Echo Dot device\n3) Link the skill to your Robomow account by logging in with your email and password\n4) Make sure your Robomow mower is ready in your lawn\n5) Say \"Alexa, ask Robomow what it is doing\". The skill will reply with the updated status of your mower.\n6) Say \"Alexa, ask Robomow for a help.\" The skill will reply with all available options for the voice commands.\n\n\nTHIS IS THE FULL LIST OF AVAILABLE VOICE COMMANDS (with expected response times):\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow if it likes mowing\" (1-3 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow how it is doing\" (1-3 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow when it worked last\" (3-5 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow how its last operation was\" (3-5 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow what it is doing\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Tell Robomow to enable automatic operation\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow when it will mow next\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Tell Robomow to disable automatic operation\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Tell Robomow to start mowing\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Tell Robomow to stop mowing\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Tell Robomow to go home\" (10-15 seconds)\n\"Alexa, Ask Robomow for help\" (1-3 seconds)\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY & LIMITATIONS:\n- Your Robomow robotic mower needs to be fitted with a GSM module to take out the most of the Robomow skill.\n- Certain commands (like start mowing, stop mowing, go home, etc.) will only work with the latest generation (UDP) of the GSM module.\n- In some cases, it may take a few tens of seconds for the mower to respond. If a connection takes longer than usual, the skill will update you and prompt for your approval to continue by saying: \"Robomow hasn't responded yet. Shall I keep trying?\"\n- In case the skill is unable to reach your mower, it will respond with: \"I'm sorry, your Robomow is currently not responding. Please try again a bit later.\"\n- If the database of mower's recent operations is temporarily unavailable, the skill will respond with: \"I'm sorry, there is currently no response from the database. Please try again a bit later.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
