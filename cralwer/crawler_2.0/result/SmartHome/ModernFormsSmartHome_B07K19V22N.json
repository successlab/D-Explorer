Authorize the link to the Modern Forms account used with your Modern Forms app, and then Alexa will discover devices. For more details, see Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa. \n\nThe Modern Forms Smart Home skill discovers and displays your Modern Forms rooms. Each room with a fan is visually displayed as a fan. Rooms containing fans with light kits are also visually displayed as a light.\n\nFor convenience, we recommend creating Alexa groups that match the rooms in your Modern Forms app. Simply add the discovered Modern Forms rooms to those Alexa groups, and it's just like using the Modern Forms app for control, except you are using your voice. For details, see Create a Smart Home Device Group.\n\nYou can also use Alexa groups to control multiple Modern Forms Smart Fans. For example, add the Modern Forms Smart Fans and lights in your home theater, first floor bar, and recreation rooms to an Alexa group named \"Basement.\" Say, \"Alexa, set Basement lights to 60%,\" and Alexa will dim the lights in those rooms.\n\nTell Alexa to turn on or control a Modern Forms Smart fan or light that is in a room. For example, \"Alexa, turn on Kitchen light.\"\n\nConfigure an Alexa group to match a room in the Modern Forms app and tell Alexa to control that group. For example, \"Alexa, turn on Living Room fan.\"\n\nYou can use Alexa to:\n\nTurn fans or lights on or off. For example, \"Alexa, turn on Bedroom fan.\"\n\nChange fan speed. For example, \"Alexa, increase Dining Room fan speed to 6\" or \"Alexa, set Dining Room fan speed to 3.\"\n\nChange light brightness. For example, \"Alexa, set Library lights to 85%\" or \"Alexa, brighten Library lights to 99%\".\n\nChange fan season modes. For example, \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan to Summer season\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan to Winter season\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan season to Summer\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan season to Winter\u201d.\n\nFor Bluetooth fans change Breeze mode settings. For example, \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan breeze On\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan breeze Low\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan breeze High\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan breeze Medium\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Set Bedroom fan breeze Off\u201d.\n\nFor questions or comments, please visit our website at: https://modernforms.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
