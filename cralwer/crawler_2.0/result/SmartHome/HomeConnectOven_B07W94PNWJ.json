Make sure your oven is also connected to the Home Connect app.\n* Make sure remote start is activated on your oven to use this skill.\n* When you have multiple ovens, you need to say your oven's name together with \"my oven\". For example, if your oven is named \"Oliver\" in the Home Connect app, you should say \"Alexa, tell My Oven Oliver to start\". For shorter 'Smart Home' commands, you can just use your oven's name without 'my oven'.\n* If Alexa can't understand your oven names try renaming your main oven to \"Oven\" and your others with numbers. For example, name your ovens \"Oven\", \"Oven Number Two\", and \"Oven Number Three\" in the Home Connect app.\n* The synchronization of the favorite programs may take some time, to see them immediately, please delete the virtual oven from your Alexa app and ask \"Alexa, discover devices\".\n* If you have any problems with your skill, please try to reactivate it.\n\nPlease be aware that the skill might not support all home appliance features as available in the Home Connect app. We are continuously working on new version releases to improve and enrich the skill experience.
