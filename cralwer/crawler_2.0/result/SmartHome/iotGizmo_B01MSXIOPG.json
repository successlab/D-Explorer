With this skill you don't need to run the iotGizmo smartphone app to change your heating or cooling, dim lights or control other iotGizmo equipment. You just say \"Alexa, set house to 68 degrees\" or \"Alexa, brighten the light by 10 percent\" and voila, it's done.\n\nTo get started, enable the skill and link it to your iotGizmo account. When asked, please enter your iotGizmo credentials (the same as you use in the smartphone application).\n\nAfter that Alexa automatically discovers all your available iotGizmo devices.\n\nYou may turn your devices on or off: \u201cAlexa, turn on the light\u201d\nBrighten or dim your lights: \u201cAlexa, brighten the light by 10 percent\u201d or \u201cAlexa, dim the light by 10 percent\u201d\nSet lights or temperature: \u201cAlexa, set the light to 50 percent\u201d or \u201cAlexa, set the house to 72 degrees\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
