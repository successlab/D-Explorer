Looking for the remote control on movie night is now a thing of the past. Want to turn on the Projector? Simply say, \u201cAlexa, turn on living room\u201d. Want to turn up the volume? \u201cAlexa, turn up the volume by 10 on living room\u201d. \n\nSmart Home Next also supports voice commands for switching the Input Source (HDMI 1, HDMI 2, HDMI 3) and control of the 4K HDR USB Media Player (Play, Pause, REW, FF, Next, Previous, Start-over).\n\nBefore enabling Smart Home Next Skill, please ensure that you have completed the Optoma Device Registration using the Optoma Connect App -- available for iOS and Android. Open the Optoma Connect App, create an account or login, select Projector from the menu at the bottom and then select the plus (+) button. Follow the instructions to link Projector to your Optoma Connect Account, enable the Skill and link your Optoma Connect/Mydevices account to Alexa. \n\nSupported Optoma Projectors: \n\n- CinemaX P1\n- CinemaX P2\n- CinemaX Pro\n\nSmart Home Skill Voice Commands\n\"Alexa, turn on living room\"\n\"Alexa, turn off living room\"\n\"Alexa, turn up the volume by 10 on living room\"\n\u201cAlexa, turn down the volume by 10 on living room\"\n\u201cAlexa, set volume to 55 on living room\u201d\n\"Alexa, switch input to HDMI 1 on living room\"\n\"Alexa, switch input to HDMI 2 on living room\"\n\"Alexa, switch input to HDMI 3 on living room\"\n\n**4K UHD/1080p USB Media Player commands**\n\n*The play command is the only command that can be used from the Home Screen or while using another input. Using the play command while using HDMI 2 (for example) will result in a change of input \u2013 the media player will launch, and file playback will begin.\n**Next, Previous, FF, REW, Stop, Pause and Start Over commands can ONLY be used during playback of media content and or while the 4K UHD HDR Media Player is open. \n\n\"Alexa, play on living room\" (playback will begin with first video or audio file on the USB disk/drive).\n\"Alexa, pause on living room\"\n\"Alexa, stop on living room\"\n\"Alexa, next on living room\"\n\"Alexa, previous on living room\"\n\"Alexa, fast forward on living room\"\n\"Alexa, rewind on living room\"\n\"Alexa, start over on living room\" (restart playback from beginning of USB drive).\n\nTroubleshooting:\n-- Issue #1: Unable to power-on Projector using \u201cAlexa, turn on living room\u201d.\nPossible Solution 1: Ensure that Power Mode Standby is set to \"Smart Home\". From the launcher (home screen), go to \u201cSettings > Power > Power Mode (Standby)\u201d \u2013 select \u201cSmart Home\u201d. \n\n-- Issue #2: Alexa does not respond to commands.\n\nPossible Solution 1: Confirm the alias name. Go to Projector in the Optoma Connect App or go to https://mydevices.optoma.com. \n\nPossible Solution 2: Ensure ALL devices (Echo and Projector) are on the same network. \n\n-- Issue #3: Unable to select specific files on USB Drive using voice commands.\n\nPossible Solution: Alexa does not support \u201cfile names\u201d therefore when the \u201cplay\u201d command is used, playback will start with the very first file (video or audio) on the USB Drive. To navigate, simply use the \u201cprevious\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d commands to play the previous file or next file on the drive. \n\nSupport Information:\nhttps://www.optoma.com/us/support/contact-us/ (Live Chat & Online Support Form)\nUS: (510) 897-8600\nCanada: 1-888-289-6786", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
