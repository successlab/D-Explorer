This is the Smart Home skill and provides the ease and convenience of Alexa Smart Home Skill integrations, routines, and more. You can use this skill to lock (close) or unlock (open) your garage doors. At this time Alexa does not support \"close\" and \"open\" and instead uses the words \"lock\" and \"unlock\". Amazon requires that you set up a PIN code in the Alexa app in order to unlock (open) the garage door. You will be prompted for this if you enable \"unlock by voice\" in the Alexa app.\n\nThis skill works with the Tailwind garage door controller (www.gotailwind.com) Tailwind will internet enable up to 3 garage doors per device. With this skill and Tailwind, you can ask Alexa to check the status of your garage doors, or tell Alexa to lock (close) or unlock (open) them. Smart Home skills enable simple discovery, custom door names, and other convenience features. You can create custom door names in the Tailwind app.\n\nTry saying...\n\n\"Alexa, lock the garage door.\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock garage door 1\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock garage door 2\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock garage door 3\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock the Home Gate\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock tool shed east door\u201d\n\"Alexa, lock {custom door name}\u201d\n\n\"Alexa, unlock the garage door.\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock garage door 1\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock garage door 2\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock garage door 3\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock the Home Gate\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock tool shed east door\u201d\n\"Alexa, unlock {custom door name}\u201d\n\n\"Alexa, is the garage door locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is garage door 1 locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is garage door 2 locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is garage door 3 locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is the Home Gate locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is the tool shed east door locked?\u201d\n\"Alexa, is {custom door name} locked?\u201d\n\nThe Tailwind Mobile apps are available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nFor more information about Tailwind, please visit\n\nwww.gotailwind.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
