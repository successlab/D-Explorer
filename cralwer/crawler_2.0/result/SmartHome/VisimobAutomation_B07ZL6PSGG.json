Then, select the discover button that appears when you get back or say \"Alexa, discover new devices\". Just in a few seconds all of your devices will be ready to be controlled using Alexa.\n\nIn order to control your devices using Alexa all you need to do is say.\n- \"Alexa, turn off leadBox\"\n- \"Alexa, turn on leadBox\"\nThe order doesn't really matter, what matters is what you want and to whom you want.\nAfter Alexa finishes discovering your devices, you will see their names listed on the Alexa app. Those are the names you must use to control them. You can change the names of your devices in the Visimob's automation app, but make sure to run discovery again after doing that so Alexa knows they have changed.\n\nIf you haven't configured any devices at our app yet, please do so before enabling the skill, otherwise no devices are going to be discovered since you have to tell us first that you own them.\n\nYou can control several devices at once by setting a room. You can do that on the Alexa app under the Smart Home tab by selecting groups and checking the devices you want to control simultaneously. Just keep in mind giving it a simple name that you are going to remember when needed.\n\nIn case you have two devices with the same name, make sure to differ them, or we won't know which one you are referring to.\n\nWe hope you have a wonderful experience with our skill and if you have any problems at all, don't hesitate to contact us in order to get them fixed at contato@visimob.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
