Changing color temperature and Circadian mode for rooms is also supported. \nWhen selecting to turn a bulb on, the bulb will turn on running the room's currently scheduled Circadian mode. When changing brightness a range of 5 - 100% is supported. Brightness under 5% will turn bulbs off and brightness over 100% will default to 100. Alexa supports a broader range of color temperatures than TUO so when changing color temperature, the TUO system will select the closest temperature available for the current mode. We support changing rooms to Wake, Super Wake (a more intensive version of Wake), Active and Calm modes.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
