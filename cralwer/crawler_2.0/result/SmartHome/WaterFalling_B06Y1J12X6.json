Most Japanese public toilet have a button to play water flushing audio on loop to mask any awkward sounds. This helps conserve water because traditionally, people have continued flushed the toilet in order to cover \"other\" sounds.\n\nI created this Skill to play the sounds of water falling to mask the sounds of the toilet. That way I don't have to buy my own dedicated water flushing sound machine and just use the Alexa in my bathroom.\n\nYou can use it for whatever you like. If you enjoy listening to the sounds of water falling to mask the constant clamor of your thoughts before bedtime, go for it!\n\nIcon by Roundicons from FlatIcon.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
