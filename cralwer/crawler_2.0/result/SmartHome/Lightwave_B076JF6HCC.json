To get started, select the \u2018Enable Skill\u2019 button in the Alexa App to link your Lightwave account and discover your device(s).\n\nTo command your Lightwave devices using the Lightwave skill, you will need to specify by name which device you wish to control.\n\nThere are two ways to define these names:\n\n1. Use the names that you have already setup in the Lightwave App; these are displayed in and can be edited using the Lightwave App.\n\n2. Create a new Alexa \u2018group\u2019, such as \u2018Bedroom\u2019 or \u2018Downstairs\u2019, using the Alexa App. You can then add new Lightwave devices to this group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.\n\n\nOnce you know the name of your group (e.g. bedroom sockets), you can command Alexa by saying:\n\n\u201cAlexa, turn on bedroom sockets\u201d.\n\nIf you have Lightwave smart dimmers, you can change the brightness. For example: \u201cAlexa, brighten Downstairs to 60%\", or \"Alexa, dim Living room lights to 20%\u201d. When Alexa changes the brightness level, it will reference the level that was last set using Alexa or the Lightwave App.\n\nIf you have Lightwave smart radiator valves or thermostats, you can set the target temperatures. For example: \"Alexa, set bedroom to 22 degrees.\".\n\nFor more information, and a list of possible commands, please visit http://www.lightwaverf.com/alexa\n\nFind more information about connecting smart home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u.\n\nPlease note: for first generation Lightwave devices initial status and feedback of device status after an executed command is not reported.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
