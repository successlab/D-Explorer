Control your Toon smart thermostat with your voice!\nOlisto works with Philips Hue, Nest, Netatmo, Toon smart thermostat, Sonos, Somfy and many other services. You can use it even without any connected devices!\n\nTo use this skill, get the Olisto app, create an account, and link it. Create any trigg you want in the Olisto app using an Olisto Now button for the condition. Go to the Alexa skill and your Now buttons will appear under Devices. \nFor example, if you have a game corner you can create a trigg that turns on the game corner smart plug and sets the game corner lights to 42% when the \u201cgame corner\u201d Now button is activated. Then when you say: \u201cAlexa, turn on game corner,\u201d you can guess what happens.\n\nWant to control your Toon smart thermostat too? Link your Toon account to Olisto. Go to the Alexa skill and your Toon smart thermostat. The four modes (Comfort, Away, At home, Sleeping) and smart plugs will appear under Devices. You can control the Toon smart thermostat by saying: \n-\u201cAlexa, turn on At home scheme\u201d\n-\u201cAlexa, set thermostat to 70 degrees\u201d \n-\u201cAlexa, what is the temperature in here?\u201d\n\nTips: \n- Alexa has difficulty handling half degrees. So you might set 63.5 \u00b0F, but the feedback will be 64 \u00b0F. \n- Be sure to give the Olisto Now button a name that you can say clearly to Alexa\n- Be sure to tell Alexa to discover devices again after creating new Now buttons.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
