It enables the short and intuitive voice commands and allows inclusion of garage doors in Alexa's home automation routines.\n\n\u3010REQUIREMENTS\u3011\nTo enjoy this skill you need one or more Garadget controller (order at www.garadget.com).\n\n\u3010ACCOUNT LINKING\u3011\nDuring the skill activation you will be asked to link your door controllers with Alexa by logging into your existing Garadget account. Following a successful authorization proceed to \"Discover Devices\". To revoke access, disable the skill via Alexa app.\n\n\u3010SECURITY\u3011\nFor security reasons Alexa requires 4 digits PIN code when opening garage doors by voice. Once your account is linked, the PIN can be configured individually for each controller in \"Devices\" tab of Alexa app. This feature is a mandated platform requirement.\n\n\u3010USEAGE\u3011\nIn voice commands use the name of the door as it appears in Devices tab of Alexa App (e.g.\"Home\").\nAfter connecting Alexa to your Garadget, you can say commands like:\n\n- \"Alexa, open Home\"\n- \"Alexa, close Home\"\n- \"Alexa, is Home open?\"\n\nCombine multiple controllers in a group using Devices Tab of Alexa app to issue group commands and query status of multiple doors by Group Name (e.g. \"Garage\"):\n\n- \"Alexa, open Garage\"\n- \"Alexa, close Garage\"\n- \"Alexa, is Garage open?\"\n\nRoutines\nPer Amazon's support: At the moment, Garage door devices are not supported by routines.\nVote for this feature here:\nhttps://alexa.uservoice.com/forums/906892-alexa-skills-developer-voice-and-vote/suggestions/41046673-add-support-of-garage-door-devices-in-routines\n\n\u3010RESOURCES\u3011\nGaradget Store: https://www.garadget.com/store/\nCommunity board: https://community.garadget.com/\nContact Form: https://www.garadget.com/contact-us/", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
