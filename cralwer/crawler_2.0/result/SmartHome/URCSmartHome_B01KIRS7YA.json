The URC systems will aggregate devices from all connected sub-systems, even sub-systems not previously controllable by Alexa. \n \nUse the URC Smart Home Skill to try any of these phrases:\n \nAlexa, turn on Chandelier\nAlexa, dim Kitchen Pendants\nAlexa, set Thermostat to 75 degrees\nAlexa, increase Thermostat by 3 degrees\nAlexa, turn on Movie Scene\n \nNote to End Users: URC Total Control and MX HomePro are professionally-installed smart home automation and control systems. Please consult a URC dealer for a complete list of compatible sub-systems and installation information, as well as other supported phrases. Please visit www.universalremote.com to locate a Total Control or MX HomePro dealer.\n \nThe URC mobile app may not always replicate the exact standard Alexa device control behavior. For example, when controlling thermostats via Alexa, set point limits may be statically set between 50\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F regardless of the original manufacturer set point limits. \n \nScene creation with the URC Smart Home Skill was designed with the utmost flexibility in mind. Whether controlling light, shades, temperature and even today's most popular audio-video components, Alexa fully blends into your URC scene control solution giving you the flexibility of true vocal command of your smart lifestyle. Future skill iterations will allow for control of other devices not currently supported.\n \nNote to URC Dealers: A complete list of Alexa-compatible sub-systems for Total Control and MX HomePro is available on the dealer-only URC Control Room site.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
