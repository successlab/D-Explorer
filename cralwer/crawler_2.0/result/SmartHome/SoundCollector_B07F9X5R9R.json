You can then re-play or delete your captured sounds through your phone by selecting 'History' under the 'Settings' section of the 'Amazon Alexa' app. Using Sound Collector is simple, just say \"Alexa, open Sound Collector\" and Alexa will ask you to produce a sound. Alexa can collect up to 10 seconds of sound and will let you know if the sound was collected successfully. It will then ask you if you want to capture more sounds. You can say 'no' or 'stop' to finish capturing sounds. Since sounds are stored in your account, only you have access to them.", "priv": ""}
