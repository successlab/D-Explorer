This skill may share device information with Amazon. Learn more.\nRated: Guidance Suggested. This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 4,678", "des": "With this skill, you can ask Alexa to play music from Alexa music services \u2013 including Spotify Premium, Amazon Music, Pandora, Deezer, TuneIn, SiriusXM and iHeartRadio \u2013 on your Sonos One, Beam, or from an Amazon Echo device wirelessly connected to your Sonos speakers (in open beta). Start music from more than 80 other popular music services with the Sonos app, and tell Alexa to pause, resume and adjust the volume. \n\nWhen starting music on Sonos using an Amazon Echo device, you must specify the name of the speaker you wish to control. For example, you must say, \u201cAlexa, play Lorde in the living room.\u201d This is temporary as we work to refine the Alexa on Sonos beta experience and is not required for Sonos One and Beam users. For control commands like \u201cnext,\u201d \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cresume,\u201d you do not need to use the room name.\n\nExample Interactions:\n\u201cAlexa, play music for meditation in the bedroom\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, play top hits from the 1970s in the kitchen\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, pause in the kitchen\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, what is playing in the living room?\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn up the volume in the bathroom\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, volume 5 on the patio\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, repeat the song in the kitchen\u201d\n\nBeam users can try:\n\u201cAlexa, turn on the TV\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn it up\u201d\n\nSetup Steps:\n1. Click \u201cEnable\u201d to begin the setup process.\n2. Log into Sonos using your Sonos account credentials.\n3. After confirming your account information, click \u201cDiscover\u201d to find your Sonos devices, or say \u201cAlexa, discover my devices.\u201d (Note: We recommend waiting 30 seconds after discovery completes to play music.)\n4. Play music on Sonos by referring to the room names in your Sonos app. For example, if you have a Sonos room called \u201cKitchen,\u201d request \u201cAlexa, play music in the Kitchen.\u201d\n\nPlease note that you must have the Sonos app to use the Sonos skill. Download the Sonos app https://www.sonos.com/controller-app and check out the Sonos system requirements at https://support.sonos.com/s/article/126\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\u2022 If music playback initially fails, try running discovery again.\n\u2022 If you would like to rename your Sonos rooms, do so in the Sonos app, and once complete, try discovery again.\n\u2022 If Alexa responds, \u201cSomething went wrong,\u201d wait 10 seconds and try again. If the problem continues, contact Sonos customer support https://www.sonos.com/contact/voice-control/contact-options \n\nAdditional Things to Know About our Open Beta:\n\u2022 You cannot yet request playback of music from Sonos services, playlists and personal libraries.\n\u2022 You cannot yet use your voice to group rooms together. Please use the Sonos app for grouping.\n\u2022 Each time an Alexa input device hears the wake word (\u201cAlexa\u201d), the volume will be lowered on all Sonos speakers in the home so the question can be heard and you can understand the response. \n\u2022 Keep room names simple. Custom room names (e.g. David\u2019s Bedroom) work with Alexa, but Alexa might have a hard time with less common room names. \n\u2022 To control volume, we recommend always using \u201cvolume\u201d in the request. For example, \u201cVolume up in the kitchen,\u201d \u201cVolume down in the bedroom,\u201d \u201cVolume 3 on the patio,\u201d \u201cTurn up the volume in the living room.\u201d\n\nAdditional Things to Know about Sonos One and Beam:\n\u2022 Sonos One and Beam do not support the following Alexa features: Drop In, Calling and Messaging, as well as setting reminders and receiving notifications.\n\u2022 Sonos One and Beam do not yet support eBooks.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
