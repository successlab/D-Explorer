It includes the simple-to-use smart lights, plugs, switches, and more, that make life much easier. \nWith the Cync skill from GE Lighting and Alexa, you can quickly and easily control your Cync and C by GE products with just your voice or the Alexa app.\nTo get started, select the 'Enable' button in the Alexa App. You\u2019ll link your Cync or C by GE account, and discover your devices. The Cync skill is compatible with Alexa when you have at least one of our designated Wi-Fi-enabled devices in your location, including Direct Connect Smart Lights, Smart Plug, Smart Switch or Dimmer, or a C-Reach Smart Bridge. Even our Bluetooth Smart Lights will work with Alexa as long as another Wi-Fi device is present in the same location.\n\nBefore using this skill, you\u2019ll need to generate names for your devices. There are two ways to define these names:\n- Use the names you previously set up in the Cync or C by GE app. After adding or renaming a device in your app, simply say \u201cAlexa, discover devices\u201d to have them work with Amazon Alexa. You can then control those devices by their names.\n- Create an Alexa group, like \u201cBedroom\u201d or \u201cDownstairs,\u201d and add your devices to the group in the Alexa app. This lets you control multiple devices at once. More information is available at http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups.\n\nOnce you set the name or group name for your devices, you can do the following:\n - You can turn paired devices on or off. For example: \u201cAlexa, turn off my bedroom lights.\u201d\n- You can adjust brightness. For example: \u201cAlexa, brighten living room lights to 75%\u201d, or \u201cAlexa, dim the living room lights.\u201d\n- You can control the color or shade of white on your compatible smart lights. For example: \u201cAlexa, set the kitchen lights to bright white,\u201d or \u201cAlexa, set basement to blue.\u201d\nFind more information about connecting smart home devices at http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
