It allows you to check what the latest energy demand and usage values are now, month-to-date as well as the previous month. It can be used to find out which billing period your home is currently in, and allows you to turn off devices connected to pre-installed relays. Adjustments can made to the demand controller by turning demand control on or off, or by increasing or decreasing the demand limit. Inergy Home Connect can also provide estimates of last month's savings achieved by using a demand controller.
