To get started:\n \n1) Configure \u201cAreas\u201d and \u201cScenes\u201d in your PMMI Lighting system. Use area and scene names that can be clearly annunciated and avoid using special characters or numbers. For example, a scene named \u201cMaster Bedroom at 10%\u201d will not be recognized when annunciated to Alexa. Use \u201cMaster Bedroom at ten percent\u201d instead. Only PMMI Lighting Areas with a specified Display Order in the configuration are exposed to Alexa. \n\n2) Request Alexa access to your PMMI Lighting system. Submit email to support@pmmi-lighting.com with \u201cAlexa\u201d in the subject line, requesting that specific Amazon email addresses be associated with your PMMI Lighting system serial number. Provide your PMMI serial number, contact phone, and Amazon email addresses that you want to allow control of your system devices and scenes. Upon receipt of confirmation from PMMI Lighting that the request has been approved, proceed to the next step.\n\n3) Enable the PMMI Lighting skill in Alexa and discover devices. Select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App to link your PMMI Lighting system. After enabling the skill, you can discover devices in the Alexa app by pressing the \u201cAdd Device\u201d button under the PMMI Lighting skill. You can also use the voice command \u201cAlexa, discover devices.\u201d Find more information about connecting smart home devices at Connect a Smart Home Device to Alexa (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home).\n\nThe default device and scene names in Alexa are the Area and Scene names specified in the PMMI Lighting system through the system configuration file. Once discovered by Alexa, these names can be changed in Alexa. Note however, that changing a name in Alexa does not change the name used internally by the PMMI Lighting system.\n\nWithin the Alexa app, you can also create an Alexa group, like \u201cAll Upstairs\u201d or \u201cOutside Lights\u201d and add devices to the group. More information is available at Create a Smart Home Device Group (http://tinyurl.com/alexa-smart-home-groups).\n\nOnce you know the device name, group name, or scene name, you can say the following.\n\nExample Device Control:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on Master Bedroom.\"\n\u2022 \"Alexa, set Master Bedroom to 50 percent.\"\n\nExample Scene Control:\n\n\u2022 \"Alexa, turn on Movie Night\"\n\nIf you have further questions, please see our Alexa FAQ at https://pmmi-lighting.com/alexa-faq.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
