With the Skill, you can talk to Alexa to play your SoundTouch presets, pause and resume the music, skip tracks, adjust volume, find out what\u2019s playing, or turn your speaker off. And if you have more than one SoundTouch speaker, just say the word and you can play the same music on all of them. \n \nHere are a few useful things to try: \n\"Alexa, ask Bose to play Preset 1\"\n\u201cAlexa, ask Bose to skip this song\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, ask Bose to turn up the volume\u201d\n\"Alexa, ask Bose what's playing\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, ask Bose to pause\u201d \n\u201cAlexa, ask Bose to resume\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, ask Bose to turn off\u201d\n\nIf you have multiple SoundTouch speakers, you can say \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to play this song everywhere\u201d to play the same music on all of your speakers. When playing on all of your speakers, most voice requests \u2013 such as \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to skip this song\u201d or \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to turn off\u201d \u2013 will control the entire group. You can also control specific speakers by using their names. For example, \"Alexa, ask Bose to play Preset 1 in the bedroom\", \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to skip the song in the kitchen\u201d, \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to turn up the volume in the dining room\u201d, \"Alexa, ask Bose what's playing in the living room\u201d, or \u201cAlexa, ask Bose to turn off the patio\u201d. Note that turning off speakers may disband the speakers group.\n\nTo learn more about controlling multiple SoundTouch speakers, please see www.soundtouch.com/grouping\n\nBy enabling the Skill, any interactions you have with Bose through the Skill are subject to the Bose SoundTouch Privacy Policy provided below.
