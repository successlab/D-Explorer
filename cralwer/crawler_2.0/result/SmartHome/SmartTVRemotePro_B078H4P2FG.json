Just say, \"Alexa, turn on my TV\" to turn everything on.\nYou can easily combine both, basic and pro skill, and combine short all commands to get the best results.\n\nBy supporting the newest Smart Home Skill version, you can easily switch channels by using the channel name.\nSimply define a channel in the app and tell Alexa to switch to this channel on your TV.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst of all you need the same named app Smart TV Remote on your compatible Android phone.\nYou can find the Smart TV Remote app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adi.remote.phone\nInstall and setup this app in order to control your TV. You can find more information in the app description if your phone/TV is compatible and how to do that.\n\nNote, there is no app for iOS right now!\n\nAfter that you need just to connect both, Amazon Echo and the app. Therefore you have to do:\n\n1. Enable this skill in the Alexa app\n2. Login to Amazon with your Amazon credentials and scan for new devices. Now a new smart home device should appear in your list.\n3. You need to connect this device with the app. Start the Android App Smart TV Remote by adiroid, go to the app settings, enable Voice Assistant and click on Amazon Echo Smart Home Skill\n4. Enter the email address, which you used to login in step 2. We calculate a value and use this to match your app with your smart device. Your email address will not be stored!\n5. Let Alexa again search for new smart device by saying \"Alexa, search for new devices\". Alexa will not find a new device, since it already found it in step 2, but it doesn't matter.\n6. During the search the app screen will update once a connection is established.\n7. That's all, now Alexa controls your app and you can control your TV by voice.\n\nYou can disable the skill control feature without removing the connection between App and Amazon Echo by deselecting Voice Assistant in the app settings.\n\nHere is a list with available commands:\n\n\"Alexa, turn on TV\"\n\"Alexa, turn off TV\"\n\n\"Alexa, turn up the volume by 3 on TV\"\n\"Alexa, turn down the volume by 3 on TV\"\n\n\"Alexa, mute TV\"\n\"Alexa, unmute TV\"\n\n\"Alexa, change channel to 200 on TV\"\n\"Alexa, change channel to XXX on TV\" (to switch channels via channel name, ensure that you have created a channel with the same channel name in the app)\n\n\"Alexa, fast forward on TV\"\n\"Alexa, rewind on TV\"\n\"Alexa, pause TV\"\n\"Alexa, resume TV\"\n\"Alexa, play on TV\"\n\"Alexa, rewind on TV\"\n\"Alexa, stop on TV\"\n\nIf something is not working, feel free to contact me via mail.\nHave fun with the app and this skill.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
