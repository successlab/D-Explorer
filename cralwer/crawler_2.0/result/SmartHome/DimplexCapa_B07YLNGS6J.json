The Dimplex Capa app can easily be set up for voice control and lets you control sites such as home, holiday home or other sites divided into zones consisting of one or more Dimplex Alta heaters. Intelligent heat control has never been easier!\n\nAsk your voice assistant to turn the heat up or down, set your home into away mode when leaving or set custom settings for a specific time. Pre-defined sites and zones makes this easy to set up and to use. The voice control works together with your Dimplex Capa app and existing heating programs to give you full control of your heating. Comfort and eco-friendliness go hand in hand with the Dimplex Capa voice control feature.\n\nTo make the voice control feature work you will need one or more Dimplex Alta wifi controlled electrical heaters connected to the Dimplex Capa app. \n\nYou will also need to have the Alexa app installed on your device and install the Dimplex Capa skill. The Dimplex Capa app has a set up guide to connect voice control functionality. Sites and zones will need to be renamed into a common English word from a pre-defined list, a helpful wizard will guide you through the process.\n\nTo use your Dimplex Capa voice command functionality, simply use the phrase \u201cDimplex Capa\u201d (kap-pa). A full list of commands is included in the apps help section.\n\nDimplex Capa voice control is currently available in English language version.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
