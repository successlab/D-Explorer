Now you can overrule their behavior by Alexa voice commands. For example, tell Alexa to dim the lights when you want to watch a movie to create a nice atmosphere! You need physical Crownstones to make this happen. The Crownstones can be bought online at https://shop.crownstone.rocks/. \n\nIt is easy to start to use Alexa if you have Crownstones:\n+ First, install the Crownstone app on your phone (https://crownstone.rocks/app/). The app runs on iPhone and Android devices.\n+ Register yourself in the Crownstone app and remember your username and password.\n+ Configure Crownstones in the app and give them nice names that are easy to pronounce.\n+ In the Alexa app, enable the Crownstone skill and fill in the username and password you previously created for Crownstone. \n+ The names given to the individual Crownstones in the Crownstone app will be the ones you can use with Alexa. \n+ You can control the Crownstone devices now via voice commands. \n+ You need a smartphone or tablet with the Crownstone app near the Crownstones. \n+ If you want to control the Crownstones remotely, install the Crownstone app on a tablet or second smartphone and leave it at home. It now functions as a hub!\n\nTechnically, this is what will happen when you say \"Alexa, turn on the living room light\". The voice command is recognized by Alexa, it then goes to the Amazon servers, initiates a request to the Crownstone cloud, sends a push message via Apple/Google to your iPhone or Android device, which will then control the Crownstones. \n\nIf you don't have Crownstones yet, you can get them at https://shop.crownstone.rocks.
