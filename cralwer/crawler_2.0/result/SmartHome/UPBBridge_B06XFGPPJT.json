Using this skill, you can control lights and appliances as well as activate and deactivate lighting scenes.\n\nThe UPB Voice Bridge allows access to all UPB gear available from any of the licensed manufacturers of UPB. This includes PulseWorx, Simply Automated, and Web Mountain Technologies.\n\nThe easy-to-use configuration program provided with your Bridge installation, can load your network definition file or scan your installation to locate your devices. Then you can select those devices you want to control directly. The name you use with Alexa can be different than the room and device name saved in the memory of each device and can be updated at any time.\n\nWhile direct control is appropriate for some devices, the power and utility of a UPB installation is better handled with scene control. In your home when you press \u201cthis\u201d button on \u201cthat\u201d keypad a scene is activated or deactivated. The Bridge configuration program lets you see your keypads, buttons, switch rockers \u2013 any inputs to your installation \u2013 and name them so Alexa, when they are controlled ON or OFF, performs the same actions as if you pressed \u201cthis\u201d button or tapped \u201cthat\u201d switch rocker.\n\nThe devices and scenes selected for control, and the names spoken to Alexa for them, can be changed at any time using the configuration program.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThe Voice UPB Bridge requires that the Bridge hardware be installed and running 24/7 in your home. Complete instructions for installation and configuration are available on the VoiceUPBBridge.com web site in the documentation area.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
