That's useful for commands that turn things on or off, like X10 switches, or computer screens. \n\nIf your command doesn't support parameters, no problem - it will run the command whether you say, \"Turn on calculator\" or \"Turn off calculator,\" assuming \"calculator\" is the voice trigger for your command.\n\nTo get started, create an account at www.triggercmd.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
