First, download the Livy app from your app store, register with your phone number and follow the instructions in the app to complete the installation on your Livy device. \n\n2. Download the Amazon \"Alexa\" app and search for the \"Livy\" skill to activate it. To link your Livy account to your Amazon account via your Alexa app, enter your mobile number. You will receive a SMS with a 6-digit code that you enter in the app to complete the verification. \n\n3. Now all your Livy devices will be displayed in your Alexa app and will be available for further usage. Set a personalised name for the devices if necessary: you can call it \"Office\" or create an Alexa group as \"Ground Floor\" and add the device to this group. \n\n4. Now all the settings are complete. Try to set Livy in Alarm Mode with the name \"Protect Alarm Mode *Room* *Location*\", \"Alive Alarm Mode *Room* *Location*\" or the name you created when setting up the device. \n\nAlexa, activate Protect Alarm Mode Office My Home.\nAlexa, deactivate Office. \n\nLivy users can include device activation in a further routine, while device deactivation can be set up via a custom command and security pin code for only single devices.\n\nIf you want to create a custom routine from scratch, the motion sensor data is available as a routine trigger. The current motion data is also displayed in the app. \n\n5. It is also possible to retrieve the latest sensor data. \n\nAlexa, how warm is it in the office?\nAlexa, what is the temperature in the office?\n\nIn addition, Livy Alive users can use a custom request to retrieve other sensor data such as humidity, air quality, etc. via voice command. Just say:\n\nAlexa, ask Smart Living Station for humidity in the office. \nAlexa, ask Smart Living Station for air quality in the office. \n\n6. Livy Alive users can also benefit from the night light function by activating it to light their way in the dark. In addition, the night light function can be integrated into various routines. For example: When my child cries, turn on the night light.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
