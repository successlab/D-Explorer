There are two ways to specify which thermostat you want.\n\u2022 Use the thermostat names you have already set up in the MyHeating app. You can also edit these within the MyHeating app.\n\u2022 Alternatively, you can create Alexa groups in the Alexa app, like \u2018Downstairs\u2019 or \u2018Living Room\u2019 and add one or more of your Warmup smart thermostats to that group.\n\nNow you know the name of your thermostat or group containing your thermostat, you can control your heating with phrases like:\n\u2022 \u201cAlexa, set Bedroom Thermostat to 21 degrees\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAlexa, increase Central Heating by 3 degrees\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAlexa, decrease Bathroom Underfloor Heating by 5 degrees\u201d\n\nThe changes you make using Alexa will work alongside the settings you have in the MyHeating app, so if you already have a heating schedule and use Alexa to raise the temperature, the temperature will automatically revert back to your schedule on the next scheduled change of temperature. \nThat means when you\u2019re at home and use Alexa to turn up the heating, if you have a schedule, the temperature won\u2019t just stay at that higher level forever.\nIf you\u2019d like to have one temperature indefinitely, use the \u2018Fixed Temperature\u2019 mode on the MyHeating app.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
