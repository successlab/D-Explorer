For example, you can say: \u201cAlexa, it\u2019s too dark\u201d and link the command to a scene that opens all shades in the living room. \n\nA few tips for users: \nYou will need to configure a Brel Home Wi-Fi Bridge (or a Brel Home Wi-Fi Motor) together with the Brel Home App first before enabling the Alexa skill. \n\nPlease create an account, set up rooms, devices/shades, scenes, and timers properly in the Brel Hom App, making sure a plain and distinctive name is assigned to rooms, shades, scenes and timers, for clear recognition with voice commands. \n\nTo establish a link-up with Alexa, you will be requested to submit the Brel Home account info, email address, and password to Alexa.\n\nAlexa Routine feature is highly recommended.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
