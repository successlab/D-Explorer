Dim, brighten, or turn on/off lights controlled by a single switch, or a custom grouping of lights.\n\nUsing the name of your NuBryte lights, you can dim or brighten your NuBryte lighting:\n\n\"Alexa, dim the Living Room lights\"\n\u201cAlexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent\".\n\nOr turn NuBryte lighting On or Off: \n\u201cAlexa, turn on Bedroom Ceiling light\u201d.\n\n\nFor this skill you\u2019ll simply need a registered NuBryte device on your home WiFi network. On the NuBryte Alexa Skill Page, click \u2018Enable Skill\u2019 to link your NuBryte account with Alexa, authorizing it access. \n\nTo control the lights, speak the light names that are configured in the NuBryte devices. These can be configured on a NuBryte Touchpoint (Settings), or with the NuBryte App (Device List). \nUse Alexa\u2019s device discovery after changing the device names.\n\n\nTip: Give your NuBryte lights names that will be natural to speak. For example, \u201cKitchen Island\u201d, \u201cBreakfast Nook\u201d, \u201cBedroom\u201d. Do not use articles \"the\" or \"a\" or possessive \"my\" in the assigned names as these may confuse Alexa.\n\nTip: For multi-channel NuBryte devices, the Alexa-discovered device names will be a combination of the Touchpoint device name with the individual lighting fixture name.\nFor example, if a Touchpoint named \"Bedroom\" has two channels named \"Ceiling\" and \"Lamp\", then the Smarthome devices listed in the Alexa App would be \"Bedroom Ceiling\" and \"Bedroom Lamp\".\n\nTip: Create an Alexa Group, like \u201cDownstairs\u201d or \u201cKids\u2019 Bedrooms\u201d, and assign NuBryte lights accordingly. \n\n\n\nMore information about connecting devices with Alexa: http://amzn.to/291lR7u\nTips on grouping devices: http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nPlease feel free to contact us at www.nubryte.com/support with additional questions.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
