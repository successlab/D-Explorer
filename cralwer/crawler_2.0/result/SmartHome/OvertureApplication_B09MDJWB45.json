This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: overture application\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "This skill allows command and control, access to pollutants, and indoor air quality readings.\n\nOverture Smart Air Quality Monitor Room Sensor\nOur daily activities and the things we put in our homes all contribute to poor indoor air quality. So much so that the air inside can be up to 5 times more polluted than the air outside. These pollutants can irritate asthma, cause respiratory issues, and make life miserable. The sensors monitor for pollutants that contribute to poor indoor air quality: TVOC\u2019s, humidity, temperature, CO2, and PM2.5.\n\nOverture Smart Plug\nOverture\u2122 Smart Plug activates your home's fresh air system when an Overture\u2122 sensor anywhere in the home senses a rise in indoor air pollution.\nPlugs into any 120v electrical outlet and has ports to connect low-voltage wires to your home\u2019s air handler for seamless integration. Turns on the home\u2019s fresh air system to introduce fresh air into the home. Colored LED light indicator flashes to indicate when the system is engaged.\n\nOverture Smart Wall Control\nOverture\u2122 Smart Wall Controls with built-in sensors are connected to ventilation fans in rooms such as the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room in the same way you would connect a standard wall switch. When indoor air quality deteriorates, the Wall Control will automatically turn on the connected ventilation fan or range hood until air quality is improved. The Wall Control also offers the functionality of a standard wall control, meaning you can turn on and off your ventilation fan at will.\nRecommended using an electrical box of 18 cubic inches or larger. A compatibility chart is now available. Works with MOST Broan-NuTone bath fan, ventilation fan, or ADA compliant range hood. The Colored LED light indicator turns from green to yellow to red to indicate it senses poor IAQ.\n\nhttps://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/overture", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
