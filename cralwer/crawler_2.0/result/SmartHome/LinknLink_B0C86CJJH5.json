This skill allows perfect voice control of your LinknLink smart home devices, making home management easier and more efficient.\n\nPrerequisites:\n1. An iPhone/iPad or Android phone\n2. A Wi-Fi router with 2.4G band and Internet access\n3. A LinknLink smart home device\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Sign up / sign in LinknLink App\nDownload and install LinknLink App from App Store or Google Play and sign up for a LinknLink account.\nLinknLink is a free smart home app that helps you manage LinknLink smart devices on your phone, including but not limited to the media player, smart gateway, IR blaster, RF remote, temperature and humidity sensor, radar sensor, and energy monitoring devices.\n\n2. Add device\nMake sure the Wi-Fi device has been correctly configured in LinknLink App (following the wizard in the app or quick manual from the product package) and you can remotely control/access it via external networks (4G/5G).\n\n3. Enable skill\nIn Alexa App, search and enable the skill \u201cLinknLink\u201d. Then follow the wizard to link your Amazon account to your LinknLink account.\nAfter the account linking process is completed, discover devices in Alexa App or say \u201cAlexa, discover devices\u201d and make sure devices are listed and displayed with the same names in LinknLink App.\n\n4. Control device by voice\n\nNow you can say to Alexa for voice control.\nFor instance, if you added an IR blaster in LinknLink and paired it with a \"TV\", you will get a \"TV\" show up in Alexa App if the account linking is done. Then you can use voice to control it like:\n\"Alexa, turn on the TV\";\n\"Alexa, volume up on the TV\";\n\"Alexa, change the channel to 11 on the TV\";\n\"Alexa, set the TV to HDMI\"\n\nTroubleshooting:\nIf Alexa returns a voice showing the device isn\u2019t responding, there might be because the device is offline. Please try to access the device in LinknLink App. If the App shows \u201cDevice is offline\u201d, please check your network connection until you can access the device in the LinknLink app.\n\nYou can also get our support by:\nE-mail: support@linklink-iot.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
