This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: home audio", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "The HTD Home Audio Skill works hand-in-hand with the HTD Home Audio app and WGW-SLX gateway. It is compatible with the following HTD whole-house audio controllers: MC-66, MCA-66, Lync 6, and Lync 12. The skill does not provide feedback of your system\u2019s status; that is only achieved through the app.\n\nOnce the skill is linked to your HTD cloud account AND you have synced your custom zone names, source names, and presets from the HTD Home Audio App, you can use voice commands for basic zone functions such as: turning on and off a zone, selecting a source for the zone, adjusting volume for a zone, muting and unmuting a zone, and with one command setting a zone to a specific source and volume level. You can also issue global commands to turn on or off all zones and mute and unmute all zones. Presets you\u2019ve created in the HTD Home Audio app can also be launched with a simple voice command.\n\nBeyond voice: create routines using the written voice structure in your Alexa app that can be launched with the press of a button, a schedule, or triggered event. The Alexa app requires an Internet connection, but does not require you to be connected to the same home network as your HTD whole-house audio system.\n\nHTD gateway model WGW-SLX is required. The HTD Home Audio Skill will not work with any other gateway.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
