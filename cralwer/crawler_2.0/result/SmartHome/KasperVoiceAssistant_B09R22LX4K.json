Now a fully fledged ecosystem complete with Kasper\u2019s own platform\u2014 developed and maintained by our very own team of engineers, backend developers and iOS and Android developers, the system comes together with the Kasper Home App and a range of our own hardware devices equipped with smart capabilities ranging from smart switches, smart plugs, fan controller/light dimmers, smart doorbells and curtain controllers. The system is integrated through our IR enabled device- the KFO. The speciality of Kasper is that there are no limitations and fully support user autonomy: we are fully brand agnostic and can accommodate any smart device or brand that a user prefers, and its functionality and usability are as operational as if it were Kasper\u2019s own. Voice assistant integration is one of our key features- where voice commands have taken a center stage across different lifestyles and ways of living, this is an integral component of Kasper\u2019s home automation system and Alexa enhances this user experience effortlessly.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
