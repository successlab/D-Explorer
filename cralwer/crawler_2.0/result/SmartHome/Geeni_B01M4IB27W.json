With Geeni skill, you can now interact with your Geeni smart home devices by voice. \n\nYou can simply ask Alexa to turn on, turn off, dim your lights, or turn smart plugs on or off. You can also group multiple devices together into a \"Living Room\" group and say \u201cAlexa, turn on living room\u201d.\n\nTo tell Alexa which device to control, use the names you set up already in the Geeni app, or create an Alexa group, like \"Bedroom\" or \"Downstairs\", and add the device to the group.\nOnce you know the name or group of your devices, you can say commands like these: \n\u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom light.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, turn off the bedroom light.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, set the bedroom light to 50%.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, brighten the bedroom light.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, dim the bedroom light to 25%.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, set bedroom light to red.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a step by step guide:\n(1) Download our \"Geeni\" app in Google Play or the iOS App Store;\n(2) Register a new account in the \"Geeni\" app (or log in if you\u2019re already registered);\n(3) Connect the Geeni smart devices and use the \u201cGeeni\u201d app to configure them;\n(4) IMPORTANT: You can rename your devices in the Geeni app, and Alexa will refer to them by the same name.
