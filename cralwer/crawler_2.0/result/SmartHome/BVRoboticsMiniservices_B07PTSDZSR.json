Devices are based on components like arduino or nodeMCU and BVRobotics makes you available a firmware, an api set of instructions to build your devices or your \"controll applications\" and a web app to interact with your objects. \n\nThis skill allows you to interact with them also using your voice and an Alexa module.\n\nFirst of all create you private account (for free) opening the web site at: https://bviotmanager.azurewebsites.net.\n\nCreate your own device (currently a Powerplug device is the only device working with Alexa) following the instructions available here: https://www.bvrobotics.com/Miniservices1.0/UploadFirmwareNodeMCUConnections.html\n\nOnce your device is configured in the portal, you can request for an Alexa code and install the Skill.\n\nNow that the skill is installed you will simply need to associate it with your Alexa code. \nFor example, if your alexa code is 3 3 4 7 you will need to say:\n\nConfigure user 3 3 4 7 \n\nplease spell each single number and not the full value (three three four seven and not threethousandthreehundredfourtyseven)\n\nNow you will be able to ask\n\nlist devices\n\nin order to have a list of all devices you configured on the system. \nYou will be also able to say\n\nTurn on/off [device name]\n\nwhere [device name] is the description you entered for the device element into the configuration portal.\n\nIn this version of the skill you will be able to read temperature (only in celsius degrees) stored in the platform by your objects. You will simply need to say:\n\nRead [Device Name]\n\nwhere [Device Name] is the name you gave to your device in the platform", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
