It offers weather forecasts, solar forecast, scheduling for electrical devices, and load optimization. This skill is an extension of the PV-OPTIM web application, allowing users to manage their photovoltaic systems and schedule electrical devices to tailor the consumption based on their preferred operating hours and availability of solar generation. The optimization feature prioritizes consumption from local solar generation according to the solar forecast. When solar energy is unavailable, it minimizes the electricity cost by finding the best time slots to optimally schedule the electrical devices.\nRequirement: To utilize the Energy Assistant, you must initially configure the photovoltaic system and electrical devices in the PV-OPTIM web app: https://pv-optim.ase.ro. Then, you can interact with the Energy Assistant skill to request weather forecasts, solar forecast, device scheduling, and optimization. To get started, select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App and link your PV-OPTIM account using Google authentication.\nKey features of the Energy Assistant:\n- Weather forecast: ask for weather forecast for today or tomorrow. The skill aggregates weather predictions from various sources, offering details like temperature, wind speed, precipitation, UV index, cloud cover, and solar irradiation. You should also see a chart on the screen with these values. \n- Forecast of the photovoltaic power: ask for solar forecast. The skill estimates the power generated by the photovoltaic system based on weather predictions and the rated power set up by the user in the web app. The following information is provided: maximum and average power, total estimated energy, the percentage of estimated energy from potential or clear sky power, and the power curve's shape and fluctuations. You should also see the chart on the screen with these values.\n- Add devices to the daily schedule for today or tomorrow: ask to add a device to the schedule, by specifying the device's name, earliest start time, and latest end time. For e.g., \"add water heater from 10 to 19\". The skill will ask you for the operation's duration, which can be provided in hours or minutes (e.g., \"2 hours\"). The skill schedules the device to operate within the specified time frame. For e.g., after optimization, the water heater will operate for 2 hours between 10 and 19. For smooth communication, we recommend naming the devices without using abbreviations (e.g. air conditioner, not AC). \n- Optimize the daily consumption: ask to optimize the schedule for today or tomorrow. The skill optimizes the scheduled appliances to operate according to your preferences (start time, duration, end time) based on the available solar generation. When the solar generation is not enough to cover the load, the skill optimizes the schedule to minimize the electricity cost based on the tariff rates provided in the PV-OPTIM web app. The skill provides an optimized plan, specifying the optimal start and end time for each device. You should also see a chart on the screen. The optimal schedule is only a recommendation, the skill does not automatically control your devices. If you plan to control your devices according to the optimal schedule, please use Alexa Smart Home to turn them on/off.\n- Delete the schedule or remove devices from the schedule: ask to delete the schedule. The skill removes all devices from the schedule. In case you want to remove only one device, then ask to delete \"device name\" from the schedule. The skill removes the specified device from the schedule. \nIt's recommended to first ask for the solar forecast, then add devices to the schedule, and lastly request optimization. Devices can be added or removed from the schedule at any time based on your preferences. Finally, ask for optimization to find the optimal plan.\nIf you have any questions, please visit https://pv-optim.ase.ro", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
