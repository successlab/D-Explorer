Enable the Tile skill and set up your Tile devices - please make sure you grant the Device Address permission to the Tile skill\n 2. Go to \u201cDevices > Trackers\u201d to enable Find My with Alexa\n 3. Select and save the Tiles you want to find with Alexa\nOnce finished, you can simply say things like \u201cAlexa, find my keys\u201d or \u201cAlexa, ring my backpack\u201d.\n\nTile now works with Amazon Sidewalk. Supported Echo devices that are opted into Sidewalk are now able to securely locate Tiles using Sidewalk\u2019s BLE spectrum, improving the overall Tile finding experience.\n 1. Alexa will also provide -when available- the location of the Echo device that has seen your Tile recently, providing a more specific location for your lost item.\n 2. If you leave the house without your Tile, your connected Echo device will provide you the most up-to-date location of your Tile in the Tile app, so you can have peace of mind knowing where it is.\n\nIn order to ensure your Tiles work with Sidewalk, please make sure that: \n * Sidewalk and Community Finding are enabled under account settings in the Alexa app\n * Your Tile skill is granted the \u2018Device Address\u2019 permission when setting up your skill (or in the Alexa app go to \u2018Your Skills\u2019, click on the Tile skill Settings and Grant the Device Address permission to the skill)", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
