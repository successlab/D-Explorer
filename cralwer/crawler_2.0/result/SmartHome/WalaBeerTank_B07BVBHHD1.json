This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: beer tank", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "WalaBeer Tank is a voice controlled, tracked vehicle that sees you with its special 3D sensor, Walabot. It can do this by using microwaves. It doesn't even need light to see. If you ask the tank to follow you then it will try to keep you in its target zone. If you leave the zone, the tank will move accordingly to keep you about 80cm from its front.\nIt is interesting in itself, but the fun part comes when you reach your destination and ask it to give you a beer. The top part will open up and a crane will start to elevate with a beer. After you get your beer then you can just grab your RC transmitter and play with it.\nThis skill requires you to have a WalaBeer Tank. This is a 3rd party device.
