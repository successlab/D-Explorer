The Rachio Smart Hose Timer hub and valve must be on your account. This skill will not work with Rachio devices that are shared to your Rachio account. \n\nTo get started, enable the Rachio Smart Hose Timer skill in the Alexa app. You will then be guided to link your Rachio account using your Rachio account email address and password. Once your account is linked, all valves associated with your account can be controlled with this skill. \n\nYour valves will appear in the Alexa app with the valve names as they appear in the Rachio app. With this skill you can open or close the valve using the valve name. For example, you can say, \u201cAlexa, open potted plants\u201d to open a valve named \u201cpotted plants\u201d. Once you have linked your account, keep in mind that any updates made to the valve name in the Rachio app will not be reflected in the Alexa app. Likewise, if you change the valve name in the Alexa app, it will not update the name in the Rachio app.\n\nWhen you use a voice command to open a valve, it will remain open for the default Quick Run duration before automatically closing. This default duration can be adjusted in the Rachio app with these simple steps:\n1) Launch the Rachio app on Android or iOS\n2) Tap on the Rachio Smart Hose Timer from the devices list\n3) From the Valve tab, tap on the three-vertical-dot icon on the valve card\n4) Tap \u201cEdit\u201d\n5) Tap \u201cDefault Quick Run time\u201d and select your desired duration\n\n\nYou can make your watering needs easier with the following commands (example valve name shown):\n\u201cAlexa, open Backyard\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, close Pool\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, is Garden closed?\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, is Garden open?\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
