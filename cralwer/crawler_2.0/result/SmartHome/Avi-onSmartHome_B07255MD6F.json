Why? Because the RAB translates the Bluetooth signals of Avi-on compatible switches and devices into the Wi-fi signals of Amazon's Echo, Dot, Show, Spot, and other hardware. The Avi-on RAB enables you to use Alexa's voice control, and the RAB also enables you to control your Avi-on network from anywhere in the world, 24/7. \n\nTo get started, please follow these steps.\n\n1) Use the Avi-on Mobile App to add the RAB to your Avi-on account and configure the Wi-fi settings. \n2) Open Amazon's Alexa App, and find the Avi-on Skill by searching for \"Avi-on.\" \n3) Within the Alexa App, press the \"Enable Skill\" button. Enter your Avi-on username and password to link your Avi-on account and to discover your Avi-on compatible devices.\n4) Tip: Within the Alexa App, customize your devices, groups, and scenes with the same names that you used in the Avi-on App. These can be changed at any time.\n5) Tip: When using the Alexa Skill, use the customized name to specify each device so that you can keep everything straight. (If you have duplicate names, you will have a hard time using voice controls.)\n6) Tip: Keep names short and simple. Long names are very difficult for Alexa to understand and synchronize.\n\nOnce you have customized the names of your devices, groups, or scenes in Avi-on, you can speak the following commands (and many more):\n\n\"Alexa, turn on the 'coffee pot'\"\n\"Alexa, set the 'office lights' to 50%\"\n\"Alexa, dim/brighten the 'entry way lights'\"\n\"Alexa, turn on the 'after hours' scene\"\n\nFind more information about setting up Alexa with your Avi-on system here: https://support.avi-on.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005966067", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
