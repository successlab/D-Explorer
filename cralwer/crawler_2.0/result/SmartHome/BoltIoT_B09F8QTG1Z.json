Once you enter the credentials Alexa will be linked to your Bolt Cloud account.\n\nSay \"Alexa, open Bolt IoT\" to select the bolt device you want to control. This has to be done only once.\n\nIf you have only one Bolt device then you can say \"Alexa, Turn ON/OFF my Bolt device\" to control it.\n\nIf you have multiple Bolt devices, then the skill will display all of them. You can then select your Bolt device based on the Sr. No. and say \"Alexa, I want to set device < Sr. No.>\". For example:\nIf Alexa displays the following:\n1: BOLTXXXXXXX\n2: BOLTYYYYYYY\n3: BOLTZZZZZZZ\n\nAnd you want to select BOLTYYYYYYY, you need to say \"Alexa, I want to set device 2\"\nThis will set your bolt device. You can now control it by saying \"Alexa, Turn ON/OFF my Bolt device\"\n\nFollowing controls are supported:\n\nSet your Bolt Device:\n\"Alexa, open Bolt IoT\"\n\nSelect Bolt Device:\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to select device 1 in the list\"\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to select bolt 3 in the list\"\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to set device 2\"\n\nBolt Device Controls:\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to Turn ON my Bolt device\"\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to switch OFF bolt\"\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to turn ON device\"\n\nChange the Bolt device you want to control:\n\"Alexa, ask bolt IoT to show my bolt devices\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
