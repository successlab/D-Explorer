This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: chat room\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 23", "des": "Chat with an AI simulation of your favorite celebrity. Ask them anything! You can talk to anyone famous - real or fictional, living or not:\n\n Talk to George Washington\n Talk to Harry Potter\n Talk to Audrey Hepburn\n Talk to Marie Curie\n Talk to Miles Davis\n Talk to Yoda\n Talk to The Beatles\n Talk to... whoever you choose!\n\nYour celebrity chat partner will think of a topic, then you can ask them any questions about that topic. For example, if the topic is music, you can ask things like:\n\n Who's your favorite band?\n Can you play guitar?\n What song reminds you of school?\n \nYou can change your chat partner any time to a celebrity of your choice. Or say: \"I'm feeling lucky\" to get a celebrity chosen at random. To change topic, say \"Change the topic\". \n\nThe Ask Me Anything Daily Pass premium experience removes the topic restriction and lets you chat about anything at all with anyone at all for 24 hours - that's a whole day of one-on-one conversations with your favorite celebrity simulations, on any subject you like. \n\nWe'd love your feedback. Please leave a review and/or contact info@tonality.ai with comments and suggestions.\n_____________\n\nIf you like interacting with fun simulated characters on Alexa, these skills are also available:\n\n- Mr. Darcy Presents the News\n- Miss Jane\n_____________\n\nPlease note:\n1. All responses are generated by our artificial intelligence system based on Large Language Model technology (presently the GPT, Llama or Claude systems). The voice audio and the words spoken are a simulation of a given person or persons, and are not those of a real person. The Chat Room is designed for entertainment purposes, and it may generate incorrect or misleading information, or produce offensive or biased content. It is not intended to give advice and should not be used for this purpose. \n2. Our primary goal is to generate the words and phrases that your chosen celebrity would use to answer your question. We do not attempt to reproduce the vocal audio characteristics of the celebrity. Instead, for any given celebrity, we use one of a handful of generic pre-built audio voices based on gender and nationality.\n3. The system has limited knowledge of recent events, so people who became famous in recent months are unlikely to be known by the system, and answers to any questions are unlikely to reflect recent information. \n4. The system is an experimental release. You may experience timeouts when waiting for responses to a question.
