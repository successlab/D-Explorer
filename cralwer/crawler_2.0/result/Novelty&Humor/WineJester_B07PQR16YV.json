But, if you want to take a humorous look at wine descriptions, you\u2019ve found the right skill. Wine Jester spoofs the wine reviews commonly seen by taking a different approach. This skill has \u201clearned\u201d thousands of bottles of wine through osmosis and will give you a review based on your holding the wine near your Alexa device. Of course, this premise has no basis in reality, but Wine Jester lives in a world of fantasy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever attended a wine tasting, you were undoubtedly impressed by how detailed the wine experts are in describing a specific wine. They describe the color, fragrance, taste and even suggest foods to enjoy with it (pairings). Well, most of us can\u2019t detect the subtleties that these experts perceive, so Wine Jester was created. Wine Jester will randomize descriptions in those categories for red or white wines. \n\nFull disclosure: Does Wine Jester \u201cknow\u201d the wines? Of course not! But we hope you\u2019ll have fun with it! In truth, you don\u2019t need to have a wine nearby, just your imagination!\n\nHere are a few examples of what to expect:\nColor: This red is a color so dark and sensual, that you can get lost in its depths and spill the rest of the bottle, Wow!\nFragrance: You will note that this wine smells like myriad perfumes of wild cherries and wilder horses that leave you numb with thoughts of rodeos and the Wild Wild West. Fabulous!\n\nPlease enable it and check it out!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
