While this Alexa skill does not provide the visual component of this recent meme, it provides ease of accessibility for playing the well-known \"E\" sound of the meme so that it may be played in different contexts in an instant.\n\nExamples of instances in which this skill could be used is when the user doesn't understand something that somebody else told or showed him or her. By utilizing this skill, the user can add to the confusion and humorously yet skillfully make it so that both parties are confused, as the other person may not understand the history behind the famous \"E\" meme.\n\nAnother potential use for the skill is to simply bring about laughter among the users and their surroundings. While the sound clip included in this skill only lasts several seconds, people are bound to laugh because of the powerful but obscure \"E\" sound clip. This can be effectively used to lighten the mood in a somber situation or to further enhance an already friendly and joking environment.\n\nThere are no limits to uses for this skill. As long as the user is willing to expend his or her creativity, the applications for this skill are absolutely endless. While not every user will understand the meaning behind the meme that this skill embodies, the ones who do will be pleasantly delighted to discover that a dedicated skill exists for this meme. While both the employed audio clip and the skill itself are relatively simplistic, the amount of happiness and humor they can bring in their inherent absurdity justifies its existence. The skill can be used in any context to lighten up a situation, ultimately improving the quality of life of individuals around them while making the world a better place.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
