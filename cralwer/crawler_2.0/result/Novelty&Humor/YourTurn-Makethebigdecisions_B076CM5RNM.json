Your Turn allows you to let Alexa choose which of your family or friends has to do it!\n\nYour Turn provides contextual replies based upon the task that needs completing! For the best results, ask Your Turn questions in the following format: `Alexa, ask Your Turn, to choose who has to *the task*`.\n\nWhen you ask for Your Turn to decide a matter, a random name will be picked to complete that job no one wants to do! Your chosen names are stored in a list! To add a name to the list, say: `Alexa, ask Your Turn, to add *the name* to my list`. \n\nForgot which names are in your list? Simply ask Your Turn: `What items are in my list?` and the names will be read out to you! \n\nFinally, if you want to delete the list say: `Alexa, remove all items from my list`. \n\nThanks for using Your Turn! Good luck and have fun! Hopefully, you won't be picked...", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
