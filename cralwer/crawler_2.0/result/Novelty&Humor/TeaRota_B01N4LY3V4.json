If so, do you also find that there are certain people in the office/bay that NEVER make tea? If so, this skill is for you. Just add the list of all the tea makers to the skill and ask \"whose next\". Alexa will randomly select the next person to get the tea. Who can say fairer then that?\n\n***Version 1.1 Release***\nWe've taken on board your feedback with regards to Alexa not recognizing names correctly. A confirmation is now required to add the name to the rota. You can also remove individual names now instead of clearing the whole rota.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
