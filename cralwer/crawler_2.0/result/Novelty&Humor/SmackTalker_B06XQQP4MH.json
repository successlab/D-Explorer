This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: smack talker", "reviewnum": " 2,701", "des": "Smack Talker allows users to have Alexa talk smack in her funny, robot voice. You can ask Smack Talker to speak directly \"to\" someone, for example, \"Tell Smack Talker to speak to John,\" and this will grab a random insult and say it to John.\n\nList of available commands:\n1. Alexa, open Smack Talker.\n2. Alexa, tell Smack Talker to speak to Ben.\n3. Alexa, ask Smack Talker to talk about Yo Mama.\n4. Alexa, tell Smack Talker to speak to Ben about Yo Mama.\n5. Alexa, ask Smack Talker to repeat the last insult.\n\nSmack Talker can also speak \"about\" different topics, such as Yo Mama, someone's Love Life, or Fantasy Football. For instance, saying, \"Tell Smack Talker to talk smack about Yo Mama\" will initiate an insult about Yo Mama.\n\nThese two features can also be combined, so you can ask Smack Talker to speak \"to\" someone \"about\" a category. Example: \"Ask Smack Talker to speak to Kyle about his Love Life.\" This will then trigger Alexa to talk some serious smack to the name for that specific category. If a category is not provided, then it will use a general set of insults.\n\nNotes for users -\n\nCurrently, there are a limited set of categories. The plan is to expand this list with more insults in the future. The current list contains:\n\nYo Mama\nLove Life\nFantasy Football\n\nWhile there is some vulgarity for humor's sake, Smack Talker will never make any racial, ethnic, or religious slurs, nor will it ever have an insult towards someone's sexual orientation or preference.\n\nHave fun talking major smack to your friends and family!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
