You can use it too. :-)\n\nMy Mom will probably never see this. I'll just call her on the phone and have her enable the skill while I'm talking with her.\n\nThat means that the description here is just for you. (Hi! (Waving)) I hope you are having fun using Amazon's Alexa. I'm having fun making skills for myself and awesome people like you. This skill, for instance, was fun because I got my synth out to create the music you hear at the beginning. It took me a couple of hours going through sounds and playing around. I like what I came up with. I think it sounds like the music is saying \"Good Morning.\" In fact, if you say to yourself or out loud \"Good Morning\" as you hear the music, it'll be like I'm answering you. That'll be fun. \n\nThis skill goes perfectly as one of the first skills you listen to as you start your day. A nice, energetic, smiling me wishing you a great day! If I add it to my own morning routine it will be like I'm talking to myself. That will be weird. It's always kinda strange when you hear your own voice. Plus, I'll hear things I will want to fix. But that might be a good thing. I'll just record more \"Good Mornings\" that you'll get to hear. \n\n[Note to self, you used the \"Dusky Swells Synth Brass,\" under \"Instrument Rack/Brass.\"] \n\nOh ya, I almost forgot to mention. My \"Good Mornings\" are randomized. You should get a new one every time you play the skill. In fact, you'll get a different one from other people who play the skill. The one you hear will be specially picked for you by the universe and the computer algorithm that does the randomization. Just assume it's because you're special. And hey, if you enjoy this skill you'll be special to me. :-) And my Mom. :-)\n\nI've better go now. I need to find an icon to go with this skill. ... I found one! It's from Freepik.com, created by Creativeart. I hope you like it. \n\nBTW, if you want to create skills like this, it's easy with the fantastic software I use that makes it easy for creative people to make skills. It's at getstoryline.com. Please tell them I sent you. \n\nHave a Good Morning - Yancey Zengrant", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
