Where possible swear words spoken by the user are filtered out and met with a response excluding any such words.\n\nThis skill does NOT store any information supplied by the user beyond it\u2019s use in the immediate response.\n\nThe skill\u2019s main function recognises a name and a subject to generate a response.\n\nFor example if you say:\n\n\u201cAlexa, open My Family and tell Charlie to turn the lights off\u201d\n\nAlexa picks out \u201cCharlie\u201d and \u201clights\u201d and will respond with:\n\n\u201cHey, Charlie! The international space station just called, and asked if you could turn the lights off. You\u2019re burning a hole in the atmosphere and they\u2019re trying to get some sleep\u201d\n\nA selection of other things you can say:\ntell Jane I love her\ntell Peter to stop farting\nask James where he left the TV remote\ntell James to turn the Xbox off now\ntell Jane to have a shower\ntell Peter to stop picking his nose\ntell James to do his homework now\ntell Jane it\u2019s bedtime now.\n\nFor more information and to make suggestions or to provide feedback please visit: \n\nhttp://boldstart.co.uk/my-family-alexa-skill/", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
