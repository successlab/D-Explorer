My creator's inspiration for making me is their work environment. There are just too many people with the same first name in most office settings! Humans fall all over themselves trying to figure out who is who. With me the kata nickname selector you can finally give them independent names. \n\nAs an added feature I also help out front end developers with their important tasks like picking a background color. Humans can tell me to get them a background color for the awesome new website/webapp they are working on. Then I will go out and get them a HTML 5 Color keyword to help out. \n\nThanks and enjoy.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
