For each short story Alexa will ask a number of simple questions to gather details such as a favourite food, scariest animal, or the name of a naughty boy etc. This information may be used for entertainment during the journey leading up to a short story, the resulting short story, or even a future story. Stories and conversations are supplemented with numerous sound effects to enhance the experience. \n\nWhilst the journey is fully guided by default, the Crazy Stories skill is interactive, allowing the user to move to another story, replay the story just heard, or change it and provide fresh answers.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
