Her extra sensory abilities enable her to easily peer into your memories and experience conversations you\u2019ve had, as well as, sounds you\u2019ve heard. These are the sources of the Little Secrets she\u2019ll reveal. Of course, these are entirely fictitious and meant to be fun! \n\nHer brother, Eric, also a psychic, turned comedy writer is willing to share his own \"Deeper Thoughts\" based on similar observations made possible by his psychic abilities. Ashley\u2019s \u201cLittle Secrets\u201d are typically balanced, coupling somewhat negative observations with positive ones. They are entirely free. Eric\u2019s \u201cDeeper Thoughts\u201d are a bit blunter and require a small, one-time fee to hear. All the responses are entirely fictitious and are meant to be a humorous peak into your world!\n\nIf a Little Secret or Deeper Thought seems appropriate to you, it was only a guess!\n\nI hope you enjoy this little spoof!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
