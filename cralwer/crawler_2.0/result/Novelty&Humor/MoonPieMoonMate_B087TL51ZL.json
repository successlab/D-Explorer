I make it more fun to stay inside (which is where we all need to be for just a little while longer), because I\u2019m something to talk to while you stare at the wall. You can ask me questions and we can chat about lots of stuff, even if it's not MoonPies. \n\nAlso, please remember that none of this is real and I am just an Alexa skill designed to have fun with you, so if you need to talk to someone please consult a therapist or medical professional.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
