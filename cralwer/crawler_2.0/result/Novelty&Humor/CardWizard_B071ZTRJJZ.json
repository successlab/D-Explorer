(After you secretly hint what card she should guess, of course.)\n\nHow It Works:\n\nAlexa will ask a series of questions and your responses as the wizard will secretly inform her what card she should guess. But when your friends try, Alexa will call them out as the phony wizards they are!\n\nWhen Alexa asks for a wizard, answer...\n- \"Yes\".\n\nIn your head, divide the value of the card by four and remember the whole portion. When Alexa asks if you have a card, answer:\n- \"Alright\" if the whole portion is 0.\n- \"Got it\" if the whole portion is 1.\n- \"Okay\" if the whole portion is 2.\n- \"Ready\" if the whole portion is 3.\n\nNow remember the remainder portion when the value of the card is divided by four. When Alexa asks you perform the first action, answer:\n- \"Alright\" if the remainder is 0.\n- \"Got it\" if the remainder is 1.\n- \"Okay\" if the remainder is 2.\n- \"Ready\" if the remainder is 3.\n\nWhen Alexa asks you perform the second action, answer:\n- \"Yes\"\n\nWhen Alexa asks you perform the final action, answer:\n- \"Alright\" if the suit is Clubs.\n- \"Got it\" if the suit is Diamonds.\n- \"Okay\" if the suit is Hearts.\n- \"Ready\" if the suit is Spades.\n\nThe value of Ace is 1, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, and King is 13. Suits and responses are ordered alphabetically.\n\nExample:\n\nDraw a card from the deck, for example Two of Diamonds.\nAlexa: Is there a wizard that can assist me?\nWizard: Yes.\nAlexa: Do you have a card ready?\nWizard: Alright. (The whole portion of 2 \u00f7 4 is 0.)\nAlexa: Hold the card to your left ear. Ready?\nWizard: Okay. (The remainder of 2 \u00f7 4 is 2.)\nAlexa: Hold the card in front of your right eye. Ready?\nWizard: Yes.\nAlexa: Hold the card to your head and concentrate on it. Ready?\nWizard: Got it. (Suit is Diamonds.)\nAlexa: Your card is the Two of Hearts.\n\nPlease send any quesitons, comments, or feedback to invocate.io@gmail.com", "priv": ""}
