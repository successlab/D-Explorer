Tap each echo button once to light them up. At the beginning of replay, candles will glow. The candles will burn for ten minutes, uninterrupted. You may keep the candles glowing during the entire sixteen-minutes. Tap each button once after seven or eight minutes. When replay completes, say 'Alexa, ask freedom buttons to stop' to extinguish the candles.\n\nTo listen to the Reverend's remarks in entirety, say \n'Alexa, open freedom buttons'\n'Alexa, ask freedom buttons to replay his poem'\n'Alexa, ask freedom buttons to commemorate dr martin luther king jr day' \n'Alexa, ask freedom buttons to peacefully march'", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
