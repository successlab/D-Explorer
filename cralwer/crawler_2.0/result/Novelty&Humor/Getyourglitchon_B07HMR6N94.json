Now you can use this skill to impress your friends with a cool Alexa trick and at the same time, maybe, just maybe spark their interest in a great historical figure.\n\nThe skill has been launched exclusively with the quotes of Benjamin Franklin and will be updated in the future with glitched up quotes from other amazing people of history.\n\nTo get a glitched quote just yell out \"Alexa, get your glitch on\". Each time you request a quote the skill will send a card to your Alexa app so you can see the exact wording of the quote and who said it (as sometimes the glitch can render the words indecipherable). After you get a glitched quote Alexa will ask if you want another, say \"Yes\" (or \"another glitch\") for another one and \"No\" to exit the skill.\n\nLeave feedback or contact steven.bowden@protonmail.com with other historical figures you'd like to have glitched (their quotes will need to be public domain in terms of copyright).\n\nPrivacy information\nThis skill does not collect any personal information from customers.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
