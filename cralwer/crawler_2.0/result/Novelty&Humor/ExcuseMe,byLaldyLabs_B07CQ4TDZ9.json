The Defender of the Indefensible. The Paragon of Pretext.\n\nTo use this skill, just say:\n\n Alexa, open Excuse Me\n or\n Alexa, ask Excuse Me for an excuse\n\nIf you think the first excuse will just get you into deeper trouble, just keep going till you find the right one for the occasion. Don't worry, you're far more likely to run out of time than excuses.\n\nYou can say things like\u2026\n\n Get me another\n or\n Another excuse please\n or\n Let's hear more\n\nOther things you can ask:\n\n How many excuses do you know?\n Could you repeat that please?\n\nIf you forget all this, just say Help.

Excuse Me drops each one into a card in your Alexa app. So after playing with the skill for a while, you'll have a stock of great excuses right there on your phone whenever you need one! \n\nExcuse Me is intended for fun, and what could be more fun than dodging the things you just don't want to do?", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
