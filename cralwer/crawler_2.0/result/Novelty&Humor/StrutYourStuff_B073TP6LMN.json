Simply ask Alexa to \"Strut Your Stuff\" and she'll show off one of her talents at random. You can also choose a particular talent by saying, \"ask Strut Your Stuff to demonstrate (name of talent)\" substituting the name of one of her talents such as Falling, Gibberish, Interjections, Jabberwocky, Rooster, Sheldon, or Whisper. There are a few others. See if you can guess their names.\n\nIf you ask for a Menu, you'll get a message explaining how to get Alexa to perform a specific talent. Check your Alexa app for a written version of the instructions.\n\nThat's it, at least for now. Have fun!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
