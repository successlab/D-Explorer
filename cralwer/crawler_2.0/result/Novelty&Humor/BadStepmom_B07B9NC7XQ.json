It exists primarily to be snarky and deny your requests. However, it does have two pieces of regular functionality.\n\n- It can set reminders. However, it will only tell you about those reminders the first time it is opened after the reminder has expired.\n\n- It can define words using the Oxford English Dictionary API. These definitions are presented in a condescending manner.\n\nIt can also accept a wide variety of requests for many other things, but it will always give a snarky denial for any of those requests.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
