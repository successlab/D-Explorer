Sporting a dramatic cape or an oversized beret, they stride onto the stage with an air of exaggerated seriousness, only to deliver punchline-packed haikus that catch the audience off guard. Their voice shifts unpredictably between solemn whispers and booming proclamations, adding an extra layer of hilarity to each carefully crafted syllable. They often pause for effect, raising an eyebrow or striking an over-the-top pose before delivering the final line, ensuring laughs every time. Props like an absurdly large quill or a tiny gong might accompany their readings, amplifying their whimsical style. With a knack for blending poetic elegance and pure silliness, this haiku reader makes even the most mundane topics unexpectedly delightful.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
