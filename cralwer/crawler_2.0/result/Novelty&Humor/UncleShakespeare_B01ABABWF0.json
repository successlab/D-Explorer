Words are chosen at random from a bank of Shakespeare's adjectives and nouns, delivered in sentence form.\n\nInspired by the many 'Shakespeare Insult' web pages and the (original?) Shakespeare insult worksheet created long ago by Jerry Maquire, English Teacher at Center Grove High School in Greenwood, Indiana.\n\nFeedback and suggestions are welcome!\nThanks for trying the skill.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
