Its sixteen episodes will take you from San Francisco to Paris, and then on to another world. And you can explore the world of the story and its characters in new ways.\n\nHere Boy, by Ronald Martinez, is a love story.\n\nWilla is a reasonably successful actress, now past the ingenue phase and well into character roles that vary widely from vamp to tough-talking career woman. In real life, Willa has a sweet, skewed view of what she believes is ultimately an incomprehensible universe. Certainly she's found the men to be incomprehensible. \n\nShe has a dog, an Irish Wolfhound named Finbar, and the two live in an enchanted lane on the Filbert steps in San Francisco, Finn in his 'hobbit house' - a large, handmade wooden doghouse - out back of the building. He comes and goes, wanders off to god knows where, but he does return, sometimes with fire in his eyes, sometimes with sadness, but he always returns. \n\nOne fateful night, far from home, Willa and Finn will share an experience that will change them both, forever.\n\nPlease join us for this original, episodic tale.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
