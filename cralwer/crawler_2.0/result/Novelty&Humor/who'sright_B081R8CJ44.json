For arguments sake (pun intended), lets say your name is Ralph and you are arguing with Peggy.\n\nFirst, launch the app by invoking it \"Alexa, tell who's right!\". Alexa will then ask for the names of the two people in the argument or who has a disagreement. The user will say two names, in this case you say \"Peggy and Ralph\", and Alexa will use \"the power or cloud analytics\" to return her answer as to who is right. *** SPOILER ALERT: the second name is always right. \n\nNever lose an argument again when you have Alexa in your corner! Great for Thanksgiving Dinner, around campus or anywhere you might find someone of differing opinion. Use the \"power of cloud analytics\" to help make your point!!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
