ELIZA was one of the first programs that attempted to communicate in natural language. The article was an attempt to demystify the behavior of the program, and included a detailed description of the program. ELIZA is based on a \"script\" consisting of patterns and corresponding responses. An appendix to the article contained the complete script for the Rogerian psychologist. I used the same script.\n\nThanks to Charles Hayden for the Java code that I modified for my use. \n\nhttp://www.chayden.net/Index.shtml", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
