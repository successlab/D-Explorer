Talk less.\"\n\nThe Dad-Bot skill is inspired by my daughter who is heading back to college. I wanted to make sure that fatherly advice was never too far away when she needs a few words of wisdom. \n\nThis special collection of advice is curated from personal experience, with lots of input from some awesome friends and family. Much of the fatherly advice has been passed down from generations. \n\n\"Dad Says: I will always love you. No matter what.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
