People get annoyed about it but don\u2019t do anything about it, they give its use in meetings the dignity of a response rather than someone saying \"what the hell are you talking about?!\" \nEven Googling \"how to deal with corporate BS\" renders no exact matches and very related matches.\n\nSo, I made this lovely little Corporate BS generator to randomly pick out phrases, which can help your application get ahead in an industry where spin, buzzwords and vagueness reign supreme.\n\nIt will sound so good that your users will just nod enthusiastically even though they have no idea.\nFew BS examples:\n\n1) Quickly cloudify equity invested collaboration and idea-sharing\nMeans: \"Use G Docs\"\n\n2) Efficiently build empowered networks\nMeans: \"Make a company\" or \"use the internet\" or \"sell things\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
