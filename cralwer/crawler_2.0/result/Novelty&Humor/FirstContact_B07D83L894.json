This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: first contact", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "\"First Contact\" is a short play written & developed by Trip Venturella for human and an Alexa-enabled smart speaker. It's a piece of scripted content that puts the user in the role of the lead character - a star-ship captain navigating first contact with an alien species - and Alexa in the role of the ship's snarky artificial intelligence. You can find the script at http://is.gd/TmAC9z.\n\nThe skill sends cue cards to whatever phone is synced with the Echo used in performance. You can see the cards on the home screen of the Alexa App. The cue cards have the actor's next line written on them. If you don't have the play memorized, don't want to use a paper script, or are just performing for friends or family, the cue cards work perfectly well. \n\n\"First Contact\" can be performed onstage, in a living room, a kitchen, outdoors - wherever you would like. Enjoy!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
