This skill is not just a soundtrack. It is ACTUAL SOUNDS played in a RANDOM order!\n\nOur Spooky Buttons skill eliminates the headaches of spending a lot of money on a CD, hiding the player, and having to pause and restart it. It also plays the sounds randomly, so your guests will be surprised and you don't get tired of hearing it over and over!\n\nTo hear a spooky sound, just say Alexa Spook Me! Or say Alexa Loop Mode On and we'll shuffle and play the sounds all evening.\n\n** EXCITING!! ** Best of all, if you have Amazon's Echo Buttons, you can put your Alexa on your front porch and press your button from some distance away to trigger the next random spooky sound at JUST THE RIGHT TIME for the unsuspecting trick-or-treater! We intentionally left the button colors off, so you can hide them easily.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
