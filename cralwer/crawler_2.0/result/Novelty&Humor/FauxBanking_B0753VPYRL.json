Alexa will ask you to place the money under the device. After a few seconds of silence, she will accept the deposit and ask if you would like anything else. You can then check your balance, withdraw funds, or deposit more. The skill will keep track of your balance until you let it close. \n\nTry withdrawing more money than you have \"deposited\" and get an \"overdraft fee\" message. Also try to talk to a customer service representative.\n\n*This app does not represent an actual bank or require that you use actual money for anything. The app will not remember your account balance between sessions.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
