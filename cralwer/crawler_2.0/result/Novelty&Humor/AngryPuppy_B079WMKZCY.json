Your dog will go nuts listening to the Angry Puppy barking, growling, crying, and obeying your commands. You can even bark and growl and Angry Puppy will bark and growl back! Bark at him twice and he'll bark back twice. Growl at him and he'll growl back. After each outburst, he'll wait for your next command until you say stop or be quiet. Try different things and see how he'll respond. \n\nThis skill features Tux, a 9-month old Boston Terrier from NYC.
