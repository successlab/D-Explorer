The end result is usually a long-winded insult you might yell at a pirate in the heat of battle or during a duel. If you don't have much occasion to battle pirates, you could just try them out on friends, coworkers, and random strangers. Hopefully, they will be less likely to run you through with a sword. It is easy to be insulted. Just say, \"Alexa, ask Pirate Insult.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
