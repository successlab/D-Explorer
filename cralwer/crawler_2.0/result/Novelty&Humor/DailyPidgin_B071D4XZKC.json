It is used in everyday casual conversations and often used in advertising that is targeted toward locals. It originated from back in the day on the sugar cane plantations when the different workers used it as a form of communication. Taking influences from different cultures, it spread outside the plantations where children started learning it as their first language.\n\nHave fun using this skill and getting familiar with the expressions and phrases used everyday in Hawaii!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
