Harness A.I. to generate images directly from your mind! \n \n Use the command Paint, and then describe the image you want to create (descriptive prompt)! The easiest and most impressive improvement you can make is to select a creation technique for your image. For example, it could be oil painting, pencil drawing, photo-realistic. You can also ask for the image to be created in the style of a famous artist like Picasso, Dali, or Van Gough. You can still do better by using some specific keywords. Try some of the following keywords in your instructions: Highly detailed, surrealist, smooth, sharp focus, matte, elegant, the most beautiful image ever seen, illustration, digital paint, dark, gloomy, 8k, 4k, washed colors, sharp, dramatic lighting, beautiful, picture of the day, ambient lighting, epic composition. You get the idea - so have fun and let your imagination go crazy! \n \n Download your images and share your creations on socials and with friends! \n \n CONTENT: This skill is moderated not to accept descriptive prompts that contain violence, sexual images, religious and political intolerance.
