You tell the story. You'll get to sharpen your improvisation skills as you incorporate KooKoo's zany suggestions into your story...\n\nHere's a random sample to give you an idea:\n\n- Characters: Pamela the Candy-Cane Robot, Grandpa Silvertoes, Stinky Snoopie\n- Creatures: Talking Tomato, Lightning Unicorn, Cyborg Tiger\n- Locations: City of the Jellybean Dragon, Badger Cave, Neon Lake\n- Treasures: Golden Toothbrush, Shadow Coin, Sunshine Donut\n\nTip: You can ask KooKoo for all of these before you start the story, but we have more fun starting the story and adding in new elements as we go. You can even ask KooKoo natural questions during your storytime, such as \"Who lives in the forest?\" or \"What did they find in the cave?\"\n\nHave fun!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
