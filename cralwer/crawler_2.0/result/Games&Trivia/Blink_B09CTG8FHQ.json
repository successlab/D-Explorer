I sincerely hope you never find yourself in a similar situation. \n\nHowever, knowing the alphabet in morse code could come in handy.\n\nPerhaps you work at a fast food restaurant where your tyrant boss is also running for political office; If trotted out in front of the local news cameras as an example of his oh so happy employees, it might serve you well to know that \"B\" is 'dah-di-di-dit' and \"S\" is 'dah-dah-dah' in morse code. \n\nOr....\n\nMaybe you brought your roomie, who girls at college describe as 'hawt', to a family BBQ where your precocious cousin told him that she was 18 right in front of you but you know for a fact that she's only 15. Knowing how to spell out with blinks the word \"n-o-p-e\" (and your roomie knowing how to recognize it) could avoid a lot of awkwardness! \n\nWhatever your reason, I hope you have fun learning your ABCs in morse code with this skill :)", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
