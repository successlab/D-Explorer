You'll be asked to identify the Pokemon based on their silhouette (on Echo Show and Echo Spot devices) and their Pokedex description, type, and cry (on all devices). \n\nEasy Mode will quiz you on the original 151 Pokemon, but if you're a Pokemon superfan, Hard Mode is a tougher challenge that includes all 890 current Pokemon.\n\nStuck? Ask for a hint! You can hear the Pokemon's type or hear what its cry sounds like for a little extra help. You can also repeat the Pokedex description by saying \"Pokedex.\"\n\nReally stuck? You can say, \"I don't know\" to hear the correct answer, or \"Skip\" to move on to the next Pokemon \n\nFor the full experience, try Who's That Pokemon (Unofficial) on a device with a screen, where you'll see the blacked-out image of the Pokemon - just like during the anime's commercial breaks!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
