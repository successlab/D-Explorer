If your device doesn't have a screen, go to PLAYGUESSWHO.COM and play by clicking on the characters you want to hide, or click on the download button in the upper right corner of the website to print a game board on cardboard.\n\nFrom the website, you can also download and print cards of all the characters to choose from and not forget the character you choose at any time during the game.\n\nYou and Alexa will take turns asking each other questions that can only be answered with yes or no. With the information you gather, you should be able to guess the opponent's character as soon as possible.\n\nDiscover who Alexa's secret character is with your questions:\n- Does he/she wear glasses?\n- Does he have a beard?\n- Does he have a mustache?\n- Does he wear earrings?\n- Is he a brunette?\n- Does he have dark skin?\n- Is he a girl?\n- Does he wear a purple shirt?\n- Does he have long hair?\n\nWhen you think you've figured out who Alexa's chosen character is, say:\n- Is it Clara?\n\nTry to guess Alexa's character and be faster than her by asking the best questions!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
