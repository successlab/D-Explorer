Simple! Except this bridge is the bridge of DOOM! And it is made of panels of glass. It has two sides. The left side and the right side. The bridge will be at least 5 panels in length. Only one side of each panel is safe. Choose the wrong side and fall to your DOOOOOOM.\n\nChoose all the correct sides and get to the next level. As if this wasn't challenging enough, a cunning witch will attempt to lead you astray with her directions, sometimes correcting herself to test your attention!\n\nBut hold on, it gets trickier. On harder levels, the witch gets sneakier by swapping 'left' and 'right' with random words to distract you.\n\nThis skill is supported on all Alexa enabled devices, and has awesome visuals and animations for devices with screens, as well as immersive audio to make you feel as if the witch is by your side!\n\nIf you launch this skill, it will tell you to open Mini Games.\n\nHUGO FM", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
