The players should all be standing around the chairs and ready to play.\n\nWhen you open the skill, Alexa will ask you for the number of players. After you provide the number and confirm, the game will begin!\n\nAlexa will play some music. When the music starts, the players should move around the chairs in a circle. When the music stops, the players should try to sit down. Anyone who doesn't get a seat is out! The game continues until there is only one player left who is declared the winner!\n\nIt is the same game of musical chairs that everyone knows and loves, except Alexa is running the show!\n\nOnce you are ready to play, just say, \"Alexa, open Musical Chairs!\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
