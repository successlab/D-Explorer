Embark on an adventure full of dangers, puzzles, and magic. The ever-expanding game world awaits your arrival, teeming with adversaries, monsters, weapons, and items. Don't be fearful; be bold and commence a fantasy role-playing experience reminiscent of what you know from the past. Play comfortably from your sofa and don't expect the game to end quickly. Weeks filled with excitement await those who dare.\n\nIn the game, you'll encounter various monsters and engage in battles with them. You'll collect a wide array of weapons and equipment, explore locations, and traverse landscapes, caves, and cities. You'll also come across other heroes with whom you can converse and play cooperatively. The community, primarily composed of visually impaired players, is helpful and friendly. Form combat groups and brotherhoods to fight against dangerous adversaries collectively, and find companions to assist you in mastering adventures and puzzles.\n\n\"The Black Sword\" is an open-world role-playing game. This means you won't be guided through the game to make yes-no decisions; instead, you'll have a broad range of commands at your disposal and make entirely free choices to experience a role-playing adventure akin to a Dungeons & Dragons gaming night.\n\nExamples of commands include:\n\n-Look around\n-North\n-Where am I\n-Take the sword\n-Use the lever\n-Press the hidden button\n\nAt the beginning, take your time to explore the city of Kaliwasch where the game starts. And remember, it's worth saying \"HELP\" from time to time.\nContact the developer: https://tradeofwar.de or Email: support@dasschwarzeschwert.de\nThe game is constantly evolving.
