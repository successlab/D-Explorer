Let the laughs begin as you compete with friends to see who can make the most sense out of the nonsense.\n\n\u2022 HOW TO PLAY: To start the game, just tell Alexa to \"start Incohearent Game.\" Alexa will spout out some gibberish that will represent a phrase for you to guess. You can guess as many times as you want, and you'll be rewarded with a new phrase each time you guess correctly. If you're stuck, ask Alexa to skip or repeat the gibberish. To stop the game at any time, just tell Alexa \"stop\" or \"cancel.\" Compete with your friends for some laughs and good times. Enjoy!\n\n\u2022 ADULTS ONLY: This game contains mature language.
