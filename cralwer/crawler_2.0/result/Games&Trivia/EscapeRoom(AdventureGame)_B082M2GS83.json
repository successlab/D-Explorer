It is up to you to figure out how to escape!\n\nInspired by various real escape rooms. Rather than using just your smarts you will need your imagination as well. It is up to you to paint a picture of the room, interact with the environment and escape.\n\nYou have a few commands at your disposal:\n 1. Look <Direction> ex. look left - Alexa will describe the scene to you.\n 2. Inspect <Object> ex. inspect door - Alexa will describe and interact with an object in the scene more closely.\n 3. Use <Item> on <Object> ex. use hammer on window - Alexa will use on of your items to interact with an object in the environment.\n 4. Inventory - Alexa will list all the items you have.\n 5. Wait - Alexa will wait a little while. \n\nNote: Sometimes Alexa will repeat what you have already heard. You can simply interrupt her by saying \"Alexa\" followed by one of the commands above.\n\nMore rooms will be added!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
