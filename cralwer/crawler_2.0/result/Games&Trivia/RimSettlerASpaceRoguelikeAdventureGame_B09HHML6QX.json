This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: rim settler", "reviewnum": " 12", "des": "The year is 2483 and there's little left in the Core Worlds for regular folk like you. You've scrounged up enough money to buy a basic ship, hire a few crew members, and stake a claim in the Rim Colonies. However, fuel is scarce and the journey dangerous. You'll need to think fast, trust nobody, and fight hard to make it to Orion Prime. Are you up to the challenge?\n\nRim Settler is an expansive science fiction rouge-like adventure. As captain, you'll:\n- Navigate a ship through a procedurally generated galaxy\n- Make friends, allies, and enemies of the four major galactic factions\n- Guide your crew through strategic combat against unique bosses and dozens of enemies\n- Trade for ship upgrades and special powers and abilities\n- Carefully manage your resources: fuel cells, missiles, repair kits, and credits.\n- Hire crew from dozens of possible candidates - each with unique strengths and abilities\n- Unlock hidden achievements, new game modes, and ships\n\nThe best way to understand Rim Settler is to give it a try! The game includes a free demo which lets you play through a simplified version of the first quadrant with the Explorer Class ship. Just say \"Alexa, ask Rim Settler to Play a Demo Game\" to get right into the action.\n\nThere are NO micro-transactions, consumable items, or \"nickle-and-dime\" purchases. If you buy the full game once, you get all of its content. This is a premium game with more than 25,000 words of original story content, 9 unlockable player-controlled ships, and millions of possible play throughs. \n\nEach run takes about 20-45 minutes (depending on how long you survive), but if you dive back in and play again it'll be a completely different game. Beat the \"Is that All?\" achievement by completing the game with 15 spare fuel cells and you can even unlock the longer and more challenging \"Marathon Mode\" option!\n\nRim Settler is inspired by classic adventure games, like The Oregon Trail, as well as modern roguelikes like FTL and Hades. If you like these games, our hope is Rim Settler can scratch that itch too! This is the biggest skill we've ever built and we can't wait to hear what you think of it :) \n\nGood luck out there Captain! Let us know when you get to the Rim.\n\n**** HINTS & TIPS ****\n- You can ask SAL, your ship's computer, for a status report anytime Alexa is listening. This is a great way to check up on your ship upgrades, crew members, and special abilities.\n\n- All ships start with the \"Reckless Strike\" and \"Cautious Attack\" special abilities. If you're struggling in combat, try and use these tactically to make more aggressive attacks when the enemy is weak or back away when your shields are down. It's especially effective to use Reckless Strike against an enemy who has taken the Dodge action.\n\n- Want to play a longer game? Beat a run with 15 fuel cells to spare and you can unlock \"Marathon Mode\"\n\n- Friendship matters! If you help people around the galaxy, you're more likely to get discounts, gifts, and helpful advice from faction ships. However, it can be hard to befriend everyone. The Apexites and Core Alliance compete for political power and the Wardens and Coppertooth Syndicate are mortal enemies. Choose your sides carefully.\n\n- Use your abilities. All ships except the Warden Investigator have unique combat abilities. Some, like the Hacker Circuits, completely change combat.\n\n- From the main menu, you can ask for your high scores and Alexa will send a list of your completed achievements to the \"Activity\" section of the Alexa app.\n\n- Save your missiles. You can fire lasers infinitely, but you have a limited number of missiles. You can find more missiles in shipwrecks or buy them from traders.\n\n- Listen to your crew members. Depending on who you hired, they may have helpful advice regarding the situations you get into.\n\n- Feel free to take a break. Just say \"Pause\" anytime and Rim Settler will remember where you left off for when you come back.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
