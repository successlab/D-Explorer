The Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. For instance, Soundex for \"Coleman\" is C455, because 4 represents the letter L, and 5 can represent the letter M or the letter N.\n\nIn Soundex Casino I show you a Soundex code. You have to guess which surname it matches from a list of 1000 most common surnames. Some codes match multiple names, so you score if you match, and score more if you match the name I'm thinking of. You can bet before you guess. For more information on the Soundex Code, say, help soundex. For rules on scoring and betting, say, help scoring. I will drop a card with complete help into your Alexa app, under the menu called 'Activity'. (That'll be your best reference while you learn and play.)\n\nSOUNDEX\nThe Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. Consonants at a similar place of articulation share the same digit so, for example, the labial consonants B, F, P, and V are each encoded as the number 1. So far so good? \n\nTo cook up a Soundex, you follow four simple rules:\n1. Retain the first letter of the name and drop all other occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w.\n2. Replace consonants with digits as follows (after the first letter):\n b, f, p, v \u2192 1\n c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z \u2192 2\n d, t \u2192 3\n l \u2192 4 \n m, n \u2192 5\n r \u2192 6\n3. If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent in the original name (before step 1), only retain the first letter; also two letters with the same number separated by 'h' or 'w' are coded as a single number, whereas such letters separated by a vowel are coded twice. This rule also applies to the first letter. \n4. If you have too few letters in your word that you can't assign three numbers, append with zeros until there are three numbers. If you have four or more numbers, retain only the first three.\n\nSCORING\nYou start with ten coins (you're welcome).\nScore one coin by matching the Soundex without a hint.\nScore another coin by matching the exact name I was thinking of (without a hint).\nLose a coin if you guess wrong.\n\nBETTING\nBefore guessing, you can bet any amount from your coin stack.\nTo bet, say: Bet (amount) (bet-type)\nBet types:\n Straight: bet you'll get it right\n Most Common: bet you will guess the most common matching name\n Least Common: bet you will guess the least common matching name\n Blind: get a new Soundex and place a straight bet before you see it.\nPayoffs vary, and may be a function of \u03c0 or e.\nIf you ask for a bet without a (bet-type), it defaults to a straight bet.\nIf you ask for a bet without an amount, you will wager half of your coin stack \n\nOTHER COMMANDS\n\"Hint\" - you'll get a hint about the Soundex mappings for each number (it will cost you a coin for a hint, and you won't win any coins)\n\"Help scoring\" - get a summary of the scoring and betting rules\n\"Help soundex\" - brief summary of soundex, plus a display of the mapping rules on display devices (you won't win a coin)\n\"Reset\" - resets your high score (which is saved from session to session)", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
