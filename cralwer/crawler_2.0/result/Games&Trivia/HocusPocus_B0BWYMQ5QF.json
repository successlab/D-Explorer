The Leader Board is a Global Leader Board, covering ALL Hocus Pocus players, wherever they are in the world.\n\nQ \u2013 Is the Leader Board real time?\nA \u2013 Yes. The Leader Board is updated continuously, in real time, so you always get the latest information.\n\nQ - Even though I won a game, my rank stayed the same, or went down! How is that even possible?\nA \u2013 This can happen if players above you break away from sharing their score with other players. For example, let\u2019s say 2 players above you on the Leader Board share the same score. They will be in joint place. However, if one of them increases their score then they will no longer share a score and instead of there being just one joint place above you there will be 2 separate places above you, and so you\u2019ll be pushed down the rankings.\n\nQ - How can I pause a game?\nA - You can pause an existing game by saying \"STOP\". When you restart Hocus Pocus the game will continue from where you left off. \n\nQ - How can I return to the Hocus Pocus Main Menu?\nA - Just say \u201cStart New Game\u201d.\n\nQ - How can I improve the speech recognition?\nA - Some of the magical names and objects are especially challenging for Alexa. For better speech recognition try saying the full name e.g. rather than say \"Snape\" say \"Severus Snape\".\n\nQ - Which takes precedent, the books or the films?\nA - Unless otherwise specified, the books take precedent over the films.\n\nQ - How can I get a mistake in one of the questions corrected?\nA - Please contact me via the methods below.\n\nFeedback\n-------------\nI hope you\u2019ll love Hocus Pocus. \nHowever, if you have spotted any mistakes, or have any issues, please let me know on the \"Alexa Hocus Pocus\" Facebook page, or by e-mail at animal.letters@gmail.com\nI'll always do my best to resolve your issue - but if you don't contact me using one of these methods I cannot respond to you.\n\nMore games?\n------------------\nWhy not try:\n\u201cAlexa open THE Daily Question\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Feel the Pressure\u201d\n\"Alexa open Face the Music\"\n\u201cAlexa open Challenge America\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Stinky Pinky\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Animal Letters\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Bounty Hunter\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Yes Majesty\u201d\n\u201cAlexa open Monster Madness\u201d\n\"Alexa open Space Express\"\n\"Alexa open Scary Monster\"\n\"Alexa open the Daily Connection\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
