Is it bigger than a shoe box? Can you set it on fire? Is it cute? Your answers to these and more questions will help Alexa narrow down her list of possibilities and guess the household item you have in mind. \n\nWho knows? She may even share a new and interesting fact with you about the object you were thinking of. Like, did you know that the ancient Aztecs used popcorn as jewelry, and not food? Or that the average person spends 3 years of their life on the toilet? \n\nThe fun and learning never stop. So, do you think Alexa can guess your secret?\n\n\nPlease leave a review for this game in the Alexa App!
