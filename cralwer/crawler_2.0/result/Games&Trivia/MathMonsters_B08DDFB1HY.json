Rumour has it that there is buried treasure here on the Island and the Maths Monsters protect it and that they will do anything to stop people getting their hands on it. The only way to find and keep the treasure is by answering times tables questions to distract the Maths Monsters for long enough not to notice what you are doing.\n\nMaths Monsters is great for children to learn the times tables whilst having fun and competing to reach the top of the leaderboard.\n\nWe have partnered up with select schools to allow them to see the results anonymously which will allow them to help children in the classroom by working on areas of the times table where a bit more practice is required. If your child's school has given you a pass phrase, you can use it when prompted by the skill or by saying my pass phrase is, followed by your pass phrase.\n\nWe would like to thank Leamington Primary Academy for partnering up with us to make this skill.\n\nv1.0", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
