It's a guessing game, where you will hear hints about something or someone that's written on a card. Items that belong to the same category are grouped together into decks. You will receive hints and your job is to guess as many cards as possible.\n\nThe game has 5 decks:\nAnimals is available for free\nPlaces is available for free\nChristmas is available for free\nSuperheroes is available through in skill purchasing\nCelebrities is available through in skill purchasing\n\nYou firstly need to select your deck. Once you've done this you will have 100 seconds to guess as many cards as possible. \n\nWhen you give an answer, Alexa will validate if that answer is correct or not. If the answer is wrong, you'll also hear another clue. You have 6 attempts to get it right. \n\nWhen Alexa runs out of clues she will move on to the next card. \n\nTo hear a hint for the current card you can say \"hint\". There is a maximum of 6 hints per card. After that, Alexa will move on to the next card.\n\nTo skip the current card you can say \"pass\". After that, Alexa will give you a hint for the next card.\n\nWhen the timer ends, Alexa will tell you how many answers you got right and it will also give you the possibility to unlock any answers that you might have missed. Unlock answers is a feature that is available through in skill purchasing. \n--------------------------------------\nA short skill demo is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVz1Q80doNw\n--------------------------------------\nYour feedback is very important to us.
