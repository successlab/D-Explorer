You get four clues and have to work out what links the four answers. So, if the answers to the clues were John, Paul, George and Ringo, the link would be\u2026 The Beatles. Each day you'll get a new 'Linkee of the Day' to play. To solve a Linkee, shout \u201cLinkee!\u201d after each clue for a chance to guess the link. There is also a final 'hint' at the end if you need it!\n\nIf you get the link right after the first clue, not only are you clearly a Linkee Ninja, but you'll win the maximum 10 points. The points drop after each attempt, so if you need four clues to guess the link, you'll only win four points. If you fail to guess the link after the final 'hint', then it's nil points for you. Chin up. Collect points each time you play to compete on the global leader board!\n\n\u2b50Limitless Linkee\u2b50\nDon't want to wait until tomorrow for your next 'Linkee?'\nSubscribe to Limitless Linkee to play as many games as you want and race up the global leader board to become the Linkee Champion!\n\nTo play just say: \u201cAlexa, open Linkee!\u201d\n\nHere are some things you can say!\n'Alexa, open Linkee'\n'Repeat Clue'\n'Linkee!'\n\n\n\u2b50Yak Yak Games Unlimited\u2b50\nLinkee is part of Yak Yak Games, you can subscribe to get unlimited access to all our amazing questions, as well as access to premium features in Deal or No Deal, Yak Yak Quiz, Song Blast, 100K Drop, Jeff Stelling's Sports Quiz, What Came First? and Voice Blast!
