They are chirpy, with grey and brown color. They have the ability to fly at the speed of 38.5 km/hour and can even reach a speed of 50 km/hour.\n\nThese birds are aggressive and social, which increases their ability to compete with most native birds\n\nHouse Sparrows have the capability of swimming underwater! Yes, it's true. Even though these birds are not water birds, it is observed that they can actually swim underwater to move from one place to the other.\n\nHouse Sparrows love to play with dust and soil. They spoil themselves in the dust as if trying to have a bath with it.\n\nMale sparrows dominate over females during fall and winter, while females dominate during summer and spring.\n\nThey have contributed to science in a significant way. Approximately 5000 research papers have been published with these little birds as study species.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
