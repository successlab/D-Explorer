You are invited to speak to Alexa, a sentence at a time, about anything you want. A story, your feelings, your plans, whatever. At the end of each sentence, Emotional Radar will report on how it interprets your feelings. If I\u2019m not sure what you said, I\u2019ll ask you to say, redo, and you can say it again with a shorter sentence. If you need a prompt, say 'prompt'. After you say 'The End', Emotional Radar will give a summary.\n\nEmotional Radar is built using the ParallelDots emotion analysis API.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
