Our primary mission is to help carry out the Great Commission mandated by Jesus Christ when He commanded us, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you away, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\" (Matthew 28:19-20). We are committed to the opportunity granted us by God to spread the Word of God wherever our station can be heard, even to the remotest places on this planet.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
