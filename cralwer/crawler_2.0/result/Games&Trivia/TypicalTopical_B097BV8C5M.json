This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: typical topical\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Typical Topical is a demonstration game that challenges you to say things that meet a target you are given for topic, behavior and emotion. You score based on how closely you meet those targets. The skill uses textual analysis from Expert.ai to detect and determine the topic, the type of behavior described and the type of emotion expressed in the statements you make.\n\nLEVELS:\nYou can choose Easy, Medium, or Hard, to be given one, two, or three targets respectively. Say 'Easy', 'Medium' or Hard' to select a level.\n\nSCORING:\nIn each round, you will be dealt a topic, a behavior to describe, and an emotion to express.\n\u2022 Topic\nIf Expert.ai detects the exact target topic in your statement you get 10 points.\n\u2022 Behavior\nIf it detects that you incorporated the exact target behavior, you get 10 points. If you incorporate a behavior from the same general group and intensity of the target behavior, you get 4 points. If you incorporate a behavior from the same general group as the target behavior, you get 2 points.\n\u2022 Emotion\nIf it detects that you expressed exact target emotion, you get 10 points. If it detects an emotion from the same emotion group, you get 4 points.\nScoring for any category is halved if you use the exact target word (topic, behavior or emotion).\nPlease do not be frustrated if the skill does not detect something that you think should be obvious. It happens. Just as in 'Whose Line is it Anyway'... the points don't matter.\n\nNOTES:\n\u2022 If you say 'Repeat' after being dealt your targets, you can hear them again. Use this in case you are tongue-tied and need a bit more time to make up your statement.\n\u2022 Sometimes if your statement is too long, Alexa will treat it as though you said nothing at all, and ask you to say something again. Either say something a little shorter, or say 'Repeat' to repeat the targets.\n\u2022 If you say 'Repeat' after you are shown the results, you will get the same targets to try again, but you won't score. Use this to practice.\n\u2022 If you say 'Help', you will hear more details, and receive a card in your Alexa app that has all this information.\n\u2022 If you say 'Goodbye', you'll hear your final score before you leave.\n\nFor more information on Expert.ai, visit https://Expert.ai\nThe list of behavioral and emotion traits can be found at https://docs.expert.ai/nlapi/v2/reference/categories/\nThe list of detectable topics can be found at https://docs.expert.ai/nlapi/v2/reference/topics/", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
