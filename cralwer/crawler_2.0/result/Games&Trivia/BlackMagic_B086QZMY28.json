As a passionate wizard in search of arcane knowledge, you come across a secret dungeon. Here you find a large number of items including ingredients for ancient spells and rare potions. You also find a grimoire detailing how to combine the ingredients. Unfortunately, the spells within this book are written in an encrypted way so that only a true wizard can read them.\n\nYou decide to try and decipher it and the only thing that you can figure out initially is that out of each set of 10 consecutive words, only 1 word is the right ingredient for the spell!. You realise that all the ingredients have something in common , but you\u2019re not quite sure what! \n\nThe grimoire however suddenly comes to life and offers to help you. It will read you each 10 words set and will ask you about each ingredient in the set if it\u2019s the right one or not. You can only pick 2 ingredients per set and the grimoire will say if your choice was right or not. At the end of each group of ingredients, you may ask the grimoire for the right ingredient\u2026but there\u2019s a price you got to pay for knowledge!\n\n\n*********. Instructions to use: *********\n\nFirstly you need to enable the skill. Then you can ask Alexa (via the app or an Alexa-enabled device) to \u201cOpen Black Magic\u201d.\n\nOnce the skill will open, you will be greeted by a welcome message , briefly giving you a bit of context and the instructions on how to play. \n\nIt\u2019s a fairly simple game to play. Alexa will read to you one word at a time , ask you if that\u2019s the correct ingredient for a spell and you can answer with either \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d. Out of the 10 items that Alexa will read to you in a game session, only 1 of them is the correct ingredient. Per game session, you can only pick 2 ingredients which you believe might include the correct one (you can only say \u201cYES\u201d 2 times per round of game). \n\nAt the end of each round, if you haven\u2019t guessed the ingredient, Alexa will ask if you want to know which was the correct ingredient (simply say \u201cwhat was the ingredient\u2019).\n\nYour mission in this game is to find the rule by which the correct ingredient is chosen.To do so, we encourage you to take notes along the way. This is not an easy game. You need to use your imagination and think hard in order to uncover the mystery. Write down anything you think it\u2019s relevant , as you will need to make connection that are not obvious at the first glance. Once you figure it you, try and challenge your friends. Or try to uncover it together as a group effort.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
