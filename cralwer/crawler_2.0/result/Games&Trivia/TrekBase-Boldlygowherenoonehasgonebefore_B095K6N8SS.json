This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: trek base", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "This is an unofficial skill telling you stories and facts about characters, concepts and alien life forms from the Star Trek universe. The contents of the material is based on articles from Wikipedia. \n\nOne strength of this skill is the intelligent keyword recognition from the context of the search query. This helps when looking for ambiguous terms. For example compare \"What is Enterprise as series?\" vs. \"what is the spaceship enterprise?\"\n\nFurthermore the skill will find related articles:\n\"Who is Annika Hansen?\" ==> Information about \"Seven of Nine\" from Star Trek Voyager\n\nThe quality of the search result rises and falls with the scope of the appropriate context in the query. In the end, whether the context \"fits\" depends on the keywords in the Wikipedia article.\n\nSee some more examples:\n\n \"Who is Commander Data\"\n \"Who is Jean Luc Picard\"\n \"Who is Mister Spock\"\n \"Who is Worf\"\n \"Who is Beverly Crusher\"\n \"Who is Seven of nine\"\n \"Who is Captain Janeway\"\n \"Search for Benjamin Sisko\"\n \"What is Deep Space Nine\"\n \"What is Star Trek Voyager\"\n \"What are Tribbles\"\n \"What is a Transporter\"\n \"What is a Tricorder\"\n \"What is a Photon Torpedo\"\n \"Tell me something about the movie 'Generations'\"\n \"Tell me something about the movie 'First Contact'\"\n \"Tell me something about the movie 'Nemesis\"\n \"Tell me something about the Borg\"\n \"Tell me something about the Vulcans\"\n \"Tell me something about the species 8472\"\n \"Tell me something about the 'Q'\"\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAmong many others the following search patterns are supported:\n\n- \"Search for {text}\"\n- \"Ask for {text} \"\n- \"What is the meaning of {text}\"\n- \"Who is {text}\"\n- \"What is {text}\"\n- \"Who was {text}\"\n- \"What was {text}\"\n- \"Tell me something about {text}\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAt any time you may interrupt Alexa by saying \n- \"Alexa, give me another example\"\n\nYou can ask Alexa to repeat reading the last or current article from the beginning by saying:\n- \"Alexa, repeat\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
