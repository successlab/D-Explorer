You will need to catch the animals before they get all the flowers.\n\nEach level is completed when there are neither flowers nor animals left. You work to complete the level before you run out of time or energy. Receive more energy by collecting flowers instead of shooting them. The game goes faster over time and as you pass each level. Test your skills against more animals appearing at speed.\n\nVoice commands:\n- Alexa, open Garden Party\n- go up\n- go down\n- go left\n- go right\n- Fire!\n- Restart!\n\nWant to go faster? Stack your command sequences to speed up the game. Some examples:\n\n- 'Fire, Fire, Fire'\n- 'Three times Fire'\n- 'Two times right, turn up, Fire'\n- 'Six times Forward, turn Left, Forward'\n\n\n'Garden Party' is a contribution to the 'Amazon Alexa Hackathon at VOICE 2020'", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
