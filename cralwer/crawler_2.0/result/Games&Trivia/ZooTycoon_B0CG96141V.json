Your job is to design, build and manage an impressive zoo that will win the hearts of visitors. You'll be accompanied by your assistant Sally, who will provide you with tips and advice. Together with your management team, which consists of three other employees, you will try to build a true zoo paradise.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n============\n\nIn Zoo Tycoon, you take on the role of an aspiring zoo director who has been tasked with building a fascinating zoo. Your adventure begins with an empty piece of land. Your first step is to build the construction yard, which serves as the hub for the further development of the zoo. Brian is the manager of the construction yard. With him you can construct buildings and enclosures to house a diverse selection of animals from all over the world. You also have to manage the handymen staff. Make sure there are enough handymen available to keep the zoo in good shape.\n\nEach animal enclosure requires special care and attention. Robert is the manager of the care centre. Make sure that the animals are comfortable and that the visitors are excited. By building enclosure upgrades, you can make the habitat more appealing to the animals. Each upgrade adds another animal to the enclosure, which in turn attracts more visitors. In the care station you can manage the care staff. The more animals you have, the more keepers you will need. \n\nA zoo is not only about animals - catering is also important. Build a restaurant to meet the needs of visitors and generate additional income. In the restaurant you will meet Mia, who is in charge of selling hot dogs. It is your job to plan how many hot dogs the restaurant should prepare per day. Too few hot dogs have a negative effect on the satisfaction of the visitors, and too many hot dogs cause a loss. The weather also plays an important role. Only when the weather is sunny many visitors will come. Negotiate with tour operators to attract more visitors or start marketing campaigns to increase the awareness of your zoo.\n\nYour decisions affect the happiness of animals and visitors alike. A happy animal will attract guests and thus increase your income. The more attractive your zoo is, the more visitors will be willing to pay for your admission. Manage your resources carefully, invest wisely and keep your zoo running smoothly.\n\nAre you ready to experience the magic of your own zoo? Build the ultimate zoo that will capture the hearts of young and old. Your adventure begins here - good luck, Zoo Director!\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n=======\n\nIn the course of your career as a zoo director, you can unlock numerous achievements. Once you have unlocked all the gold achievements, you will be crowned TOP Zoo Manager. This means that you have fulfilled all your tasks perfectly and your zoo is a world-class zoo.
