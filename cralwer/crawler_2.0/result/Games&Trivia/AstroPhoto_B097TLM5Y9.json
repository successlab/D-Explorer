This skill brings that wonder and awe right to your Alexa device!\n\nI developed this skill because the feeling of awe is associated with increased happiness. So now, every day you can get a boost to happiness. \n\nThis skill is for use primarily with Alexa devices such as the Echo Show and Echo Spot that have screens. You can use it with audio-only devices, but it will only read the image description.\n\nThe main commands are\n\n\"Text Only\" to show only the picture's description.\n\"Picture Only\" to show only the photo. \n\"Start Over\" to begin the skill from the start with the photo & Alexa reading you the description. \n\nThis skill uses the NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day API, but the creators of this skill are not affiliated with NASA in any way, but we would like to thank them for their hard work bringing wonders to us! \n\nIf you have questions or feedback, please email support@LarryNocella.com. Thank you!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
