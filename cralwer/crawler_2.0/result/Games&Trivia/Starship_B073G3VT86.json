In this demo you will be able to fight an enemy starship in a turn-based battle. Alexa will be your on-board computer. \nYour ship and the enemy ship will be randomly equipped with 2 weapons and 1 shield. \nYou can choose to fire lasers, missiles, or rail guns. Or you can choose to scan and analyze the enemy ship to get a better idea of how to destroy it, but be careful because scanning the enemy ship takes up your turn.\nThe weapons work in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. Lasers beat missiles, missiles beat rail guns, and rail guns beat lasers.\nGood luck.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
