Your job is to guide Commander Speedo through space to save the universe. Collect all energy gems and hunt the approaching monsters before they get you! Use voice commands like 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down' and 'fire' for navigation. \n\nA level is complete if there are neither gems nor monsters left. Complete the level before running out of time or energy. Receive more energy by collecting blinking gems instead of shooting them. The game is getting faster over time and each level you have to face more approaching monsters.\n\nVoice commands:\n- go up\n- go down\n- go left\n- go right\n- Fire!\n- Forward\n- Restart!\n\nCommands can be stacked to command sequences to speed up the game. Examples:\n- Fire, Fire, Fire\n- Three times Fire\n- Two times right, turn up, Fire\n- Six time Forward, turn Left, Forward\n\nEaster Egg: You may observe an error message starting with 'Sorry Dave ...'. This of course relates to the famous film scene from '2001 - A Space Odyssey' directed by Stanley Kubrick (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE).", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
