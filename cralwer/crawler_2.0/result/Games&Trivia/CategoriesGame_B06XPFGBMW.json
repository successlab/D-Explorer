This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: categories game\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 3,294", "des": "Categories Game is a fast-paced word game. In this game, you will be presented with different categories and asked to come up with a word that begins with a certain letter in each category. Stimulate your grey matter in this engaging game! The more you play, the more categories you unlock.\n\nNEW: Premium content is now available for purchase! You can get the Extra Categories pack to extend the game's variety, or a Single Hint for a little help when it gets very challenging. Extra Categories includes: Musicians, Sports Activities, Music Bands, Books, Astronomy, Video Games, Mountains, Desserts, Colleges, and Music Festivals\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\nAlexa: \"I rolled the letter A. First category is Animal...\"\nYou: \"Animal, Ant\"\nAlexa: \"Ant is correct. Great. Next category is Country\"\nYou: \"Country, Austria\"\nAlexa: \"Austria, nice answer. Next up is...\"\nAnd so on...\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Scrabble\u2122 or Scattergories\u2122, you will have tons of fun with Categories Game!\n\n** Categories Game may sometimes have trouble getting the word correctly or let you say a word that doesn't belong in the category, but we are constantly expanding the lexicon and the game keeps improving with time. Thanks for your understanding.\n\nFEEDBACK:\nIf you like the game, leaving a review will help us greatly. We are motivated by our satisfied players, so please send us any comments, ideas or issues you are having at feedback@categories-game.com. Thank you!\n\nLEADERBOARD:\nDo your quickest and sharpest to get on the leaderboard.\n- See the scoring system below.\n- Find the leaderboard at http://www.categories-game.com\n\nSCORE:\n - If you could not answer on time, had a wrong answer or Alexa had trouble understanding you (we're sorry for that), you get 0 points for the category.\n - If your answer was accepted, you get 50 minus the number of seconds it took you to answer.\n- Your score is the sum of points you received in a round.\n\nTIPS:\n- You can skip a category by saying \"Skip category\" or \"I don't know\". If you don't say anything for longer than 6 seconds the game will quit (Alexa's interface limitation).\n- You can say \"repeat category\" if you've lost track or need to buy some time to think.\n- If Alexa rolled the same letter twice or you just want to change the letter for any reason, say \"Change the letter\".\n- Try maximizing your score by acing all categories without mistakes!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
