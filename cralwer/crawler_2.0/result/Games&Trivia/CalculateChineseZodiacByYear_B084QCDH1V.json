All you need to provide is a year or date. For example, 1987, next year, today, etc. \n\nUsually, the Chinese spring festival is in January or February which brings two zodiac animals in one year. But as a Chinese, we all know if we are asked what zodiac animal it is in a particular year, it means we want to answer the animal that covers the majority of the year. For example in 2020, the year before 1/25/2020 belongs to the year of the pig and the year after 1/25 belongs to the year of the rat. But almost everyone in China will consider 2020 as the year of the rat. \n\nThe personality traits are common sense from old Chinese wisdom. It's like the horoscope in western countries which are difficult to explain in Science. So please don't try to use it to analyze the personality in your daily work.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
