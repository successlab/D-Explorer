For example, the number 7 is prime, since it's only factors are 1 and 7. During the game, Alexa will give you a number and you will have to tell whether or not it is prime. As the game progresses, the numbers will become more difficult. See how many rounds you can complete without making a mistake. If you do well enough, you might make the leaderboard!\n\nAt any time, you can say \"Leaderboard\" to hear the top players in the game, or \"Help\" to hear the instructions.\n\nTo begin playing, simply say, \"Alexa, open Prime Game!\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
