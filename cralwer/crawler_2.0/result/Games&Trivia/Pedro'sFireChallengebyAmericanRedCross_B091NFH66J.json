Each time you play, you will get a different set of challenges, making for never-ending excitement!\nThe game is designed for 4-8 year olds and is suited to individual or group play - all you need is your Alexa and your imagination! Give yourself plenty of room to complete the activities, swimming like a penguin and practicing your smoke crawl takes plenty of space, after all! \nEach time you complete the challenge, you'll earn a fire safety badge in your Alexa app. With 20 badges to collect, keep playing to collect them all!\nTo locate the badges, open your Alexa app, navigate to the More menu on the right side of the menu bar and select Activity. There you will find your badge! \nTo get started, simply say \u201cHey Alexa, open Pedro\u2019s Fire Challenge!\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
