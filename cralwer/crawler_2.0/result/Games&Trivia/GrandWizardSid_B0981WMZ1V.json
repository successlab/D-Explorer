Then you should tell any two of the values from the result in any order. Based on that, Grand wizard Sid will say the third digit.\n\nExample:\n\nStep 1: Take 3 digit number: 111\nStep 2: Sum it. (1+1+1) = 3\nStep 3: Subtract it with the initial value. (111-3) = 108.\nStep 4: Ask Grand Wizard Sid to Find the missing number for 10. Here I took the first two digits.\nYou can ask in any combination to confuse him (10,18,08,01,80,81).\n\nPlay and post the result you received.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
