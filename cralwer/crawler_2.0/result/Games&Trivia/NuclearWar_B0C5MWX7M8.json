Are you ready to lead a country, make tough decisions, and dominate the world stage? It's time to unleash your inner strategic genius!\n\nAs a leader of one of the superpowers, you'll be tasked with managing your cities, building defenses, researching advanced technologies, and, of course, launching epic nuclear bombs!\n\nChoose from five unique countries: USA, UK, China, Russia, or France, each with its own quirks and personalities. But beware, not everything is as it seems!\n\nYou'll encounter a colourful cast of characters. Meet Iona Butt from the USA, Roger Shufflebottom from the UK, Hoo Flung Dung from China, Yuri Poo-tin from Russia, and the eccentric Alex Craimant from France. These characters will negotiate with you, lie to you, and maybe even become your friends (or enemies) along the way.\n\nManage your budget wisely, invest in city research to increase your income, develop shields to protect your cities & invest in nuclear tech to bomb your foes.\n\nBe prepared for unexpected twists and turns. Each country has their own hidden agendas and motivations, which means you can never trust anyone completely. Will you believe what they say or play it safe?\n\nCompete against other countries, sabotage your rivals, and try to come out on top. The stakes are high, but the rewards are even higher! Win coins for your Mini Games team based on your performance. Will you be crowned the supreme ruler or end up in the ashes of defeat?\n\nNote: Nuclear War is a fictional game designed for entertainment purposes only. It does not promote or endorse real-world conflicts or violence.\n\nThis skill is part of Mini Games.\n\nIf you launch this skill, it will tell you to open Mini Games.\n\nHUGO FM", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
