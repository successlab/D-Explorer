Think of anything and Alexa will try figure it out in twenty questions or less. Try out the new Music category to see if you can stump Alexa about your favorite singer or band! \n\nJust say \"Alexa, play Twenty Questions\" to start a new game. Think of something and follow the prompts. Alexa will ask you questions that you can answer as \"yes\", \"no\", \"unknown\", \"irrelevant\", \"sometimes\", \"probably\", or \"doubtful\". She may ask seemingly strange questions or even repeat some - this is normal. You can skip a question by saying \"next\" or \"I don't know,\" but skipped questions won't count towards the twenty question limit. If Alexa guesses what you were thinking of in twenty questions or less, she wins!\n\nNote: If you're thinking of something that is not an animal or vegetable, say mineral. You can also say \"other\" if it's an abstract concept or \"unknown\" if you're not sure.\n\nBe sure to rate the game and tell us if you loved it!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
