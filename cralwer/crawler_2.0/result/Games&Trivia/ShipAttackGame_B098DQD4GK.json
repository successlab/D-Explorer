To attack, simply say \"attack B4\" for example.\nThe grid is comprised of 16 total tiles in a 4x4 orientation with columns labeled A through D and rows labeled 1-4. For example, some tiles have the following labels \"A2\", \"D4\", \"C3\", and \"B1\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
