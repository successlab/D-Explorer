Alexa will ask you questions to figure out your chosen animal, so make sure you\u2019re familiar with the basics! What color is it? Can it fly? Does it live in hot climates? Your answers to these questions will help Alexa narrow down the animal possibilities and make the best guess. Will you be able to stump Alexa, or will she be victorious in the end? \n \nAlexa knows over three hundred animals and can also tell you some interesting facts about them. Did you know that rats laugh when they are tickled? And that no polar bear has ever met a penguin?\n\nPlease leave a review for this game in the Alexa App. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the game, please contact us at feedback@azalealabs.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
