Additionally, you can play Drunken Master with up to 15 players if your party size increases - BEWARE - there will be lots of drinks flowing.\n\nTo get started just say \"Alexa, let's play Drunken Master\". \n\nAlexa will then take you through the 3 step setup process, then it's \"Game on\".\n\nOnce an instruction or task has been completed just re-invoke the skill when you're ready by saying, \"Alexa, Drunken Master\".\n\nYou're able to add players during the game, so late comers are not missing out on the fun. You're also able to remove players, so if someone reaches their limit they can be removed from the game (You'll probably need to give them directions to the bathroom. LOL!)\n\nIf you get stuck at any time or you're unsure what you need to do, just say \"help me\" and Alexa will tell you exactly what needs to be done to get the game going again.\n\nTake breaks from the game for up to 1 hour and come back to exactly where your left off allowing you to play Drunken Master at your own pace.\n\nSo, what you waiting for...... \"Let's Get Drunk!\" .\n\nFor more information check out https://waynesindustry.co.uk/drunkenmaster\n\n*****************************************************\n\nReviews would be much appreciated \n\n*****************************************************", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
