There\u2019s Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen. Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen, and of course, who could forget Rudolph? But did you know there are actually dozens and dozens of OTHER reindeer who live at the North Pole? Santa and his elves think they deserve some love too, so they created this fun little memory game to introduce you to them. One by one, they\u2019ll bring out the reindeer. Your job is to remember as many as possible and list them in the correct order.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
