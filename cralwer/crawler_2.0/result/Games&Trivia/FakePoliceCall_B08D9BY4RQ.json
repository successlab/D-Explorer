This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: fake police call", "reviewnum": " 8", "des": "This skill can be launched using motion detection routines or Alexa guard to play a fake 911 call over the speakers and scare intruders. \nAddress permission is needed for customized message that gives the device address to the fake 911 operator.\nThe first time the skill is invoked, an alarm sound will go off for 15 seconds before playing the fake call. After the fake call, the alarm sound will continue playing for 3 minutes.\nIf the skill is invoked again within 25 minutes of the first invocation, then just an alarm sound will go off in a loop for 4 minutes. This prevents the skill from playing the fake call twice if different motion triggers invoke the skill in different echo devices.\nSaying \"Alexa\" when the skill is running will stop the skill immediately and it will count as an invocation so the fake call won't play for the next 25 minutes.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
