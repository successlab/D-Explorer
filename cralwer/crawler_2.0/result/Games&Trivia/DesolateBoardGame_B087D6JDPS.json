A rescue mission was mounted, and you were on that ship as it lost use of its controls and crashed but meters from the station's entrance. After the smoke cleared, you realized you were the only survivor.\nYou made your way into the station in hopes of finding help, only to be shocked by the horrors within. You are alone. You must escape. You must survive...\nWhat is Desolate?\nDesolate is a solo-play card and dice game. You have many choices that will ultimately equate to your survival or your demise. Do you explore the first room you reveal, or press-your-luck and skip it to move on to another, and be forced to resolve the second? When you encounter an alien you must decide how much ammo you want to spend (Each ammo equals 1 die roll) in order to defeat it. Do you over-spend for a certain victory, or take a chance a spend less? When you defeat a foe and open a crate, do you take the larger more valuable resource, or the lesser valued resource that may be more useful now? Do you use a powerful one-use item early on in the game, or wait?\nThere are many choices per game, and when you die, and you will often, you will not be able to blame the roll of a die or the draw of card as much as you will have to blame yourself. You will be invested. You may yell at the dice before rolling. You may jump to your feet when you find that final power cell and fire up the escape shuttle for a sweet sweet victory.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is a fan-made Alexa implementation of the board game that is designed by Jason Glover and published by Grey Gnome Games. This version was developed to make the game accessible to blind and visually impaired players.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
