This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: name letters", "reviewnum": " 398", "des": "You and Alexa take turns guessing girls and boys names, beginning with a selected letter of the alphabet.\n\nAlexa will tell you when it's your turn. If you don't answer, Alexa will prompt you to respond for a second time. If you still fail to answer then the game will time out.\n\nIf you can't think of an answer you can say \"Don't know\". If that happens Alexa will win the game but she will also suggest answers you could have given so you can learn for future games.\n\nYou can select which letter to play by saying \u201cAlexa, Play Letter\" (then your chosen letter). For example \u201cAlexa, Play Letter F\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Play Letter W\u201d.\n\nName Letters doesn\u2019t support the letters: Q, U, X, Y and Z, as there are so few names starting with those letters.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nName Letters Scoring System:\n------------------------------------------\n\u2022 5 answers in a row - Jade\n\u2022 10 answers in a row - Amber\n\u2022 15 answers in a row - Beryl\n\u2022 20 answers in a row - Pearl\n\u2022 25 answers in a row \u2013 Ruby\n\nLeader Board Frequently Asked Questions.\n--------------------------------------------------\nQ \u2013 Do the scores and ranks on the Leader Board include every Name Letters player in the world?\nA \u2013 Yes. The Leader Board is a Global Leader Board, covering ALL Name Letters players, wherever they are in the world.\n\nQ \u2013 Is the Leader Board real time?\nA \u2013 Yes. The Leader Board is updated continuously, in real time, so you always get the latest information.\n\nQ - Even though I won a game, my rank stayed the same, or went down! How is that even possible?\nA \u2013 This can happen if players above you break away from sharing their score with other players. For example, let\u2019s say 2 players above you on the Leader Board share the same score. They will be in joint place. However, if one of them increases their score then they will no longer share a score and instead of there being just one joint place above you there will be 2 separate places above you, and so you\u2019ll be pushed down the rankings.\n\nYour favourite name missing?\n-----------------------------------------\nI am certain that not every name is included in Name Letters.\nSo please accept my apologies if your name is not present.\nBut I hope you\u2019ll still enjoy the game!\n\nFeedback\n-------------\nI hope you\u2019ll love Name Letters.
