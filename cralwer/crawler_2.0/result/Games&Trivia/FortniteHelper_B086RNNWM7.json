They can be left out in the open or hidden in certain spots. Get familiar with the map and know where you're headed after jumping out of the Battle Bus. You'll want to go to a place where you can find items as quickly as possible.\n\n*) Know Which Weapon Works Best -- There are five primary weapons in Fortnite: pistols, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Pistols are rarely the ideal weapon for a match, but they're better than nothing. Shotguns deal big damage and can drop opponents in one shot if you're close enough. SMGs fire quickly but lose accuracy the farther away you are. Assault rifles can deal significant damage from a distance and up close. Sniper rifles deal huge damage from a far distance, if you can get a headshot.\n \n*) Keep on Practicing -- Fortnite offers a Playground mode that gives players free rein of the island outside of a traditional match. This is a great way to explore the island and learn how to build without the pressure of being eliminated.\n\n*) Learn to Edit -- Editing is an advanced part of building. You can edit a wall to create an opening for a clear shot of another player, or you can replace a structure quickly before it's destroyed. These are the skills you'll see pro players use.\n\n*) Make the controls yours -- Every platform has a default control scheme, but Epic has several other options for players who want to switch up what buttons to hit. Try them all to see what feels the most comfortable.\n\n**Seriously follow us on the twitters which can lead to possible loot, vbucks and more!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
