Just follow the instructions.\n\nTo save a number, you can say \"Memorize\" and Alexa will ask you the number and what it means and use it as a nickname for that number, e.g., \"shoe size\". You can also say \"Memorize shoe size\" and Alexa will understand that the number nickname is \"shoe size\" and will ask you what the number is. Say one digit at a time. For example, if the number is 123456, say \"one, two, three, four, five, six\".\n\nIf you say \"List\", Alexa will speak each memorized number.\n\nTo make her speak a memorized number, use the word \"Speak\" followed by the nickname of the number, for example, \"Speak shoe size\". She will speak the number and then ask if you want her to repeat, teach or remove the spoken number.\n\nThe teaching process is as follows, she divides the number from three into three or four into four digits (if it is a multiple of 4) and trains each of the parts separately: first she speaks the digits of the part being trained, then asks you to repeat and checks if it is correct. After training all the parts, she starts putting the parts together and redoes the training process. If the number is 123456789, she will train as follows:\n- Stage 1.1: \"123\"\n- Phase 1.2: \"456\"\n- Phase 1.3: \"789\"\n- Phase 2: \"123,456\"\n- Phase 3: \"123.456.789\"\n\nYou can also say \"Help\", she will tell you what you can do.\n\nNote: Unfortunately, it is not possible to memorize identity documents, bank details, and passwords.\n\nThe Alexa Accessibility Award inspired this skill.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
