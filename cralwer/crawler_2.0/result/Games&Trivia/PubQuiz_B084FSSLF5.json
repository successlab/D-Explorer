You can ask about Pete's premium pub quiz group if you want more questions every week.\n\n\nMY PUB QUIZ GROUP\nIf you are a member of my premium pub quiz group you get an extra 20 questions every week!\n\n\nSUBMIT QUESTIONS\nI use some weird social network thingy called Twitter. I would love it if you sent me questions that I could read out. \nTwitter: @PeteQuiz\nhttps://twitter.com/PeteQuiz\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy can't I answer the question with an answer? \nPete is a traditional sort of bloke that likes things nice and simple. Sometimes your device can mishear the answers and it helps to avoid people shouting over each other, and it's noisy enough in the pub as it is!\n\nWho is Pete?\nPete is a legendary pub landlord from London who puts on a weekly pub quiz. He lives for his pub quiz nights and can't wait to share his pub quiz with you on Alexa. He likes a bit of banter.\n\nThe questions are too hard! It would be great to have a setting with easy questions!\nPete likes to challenge his audience and so tries to set questions that are tough, but not too tough. If you're finding it too hard going then please let us know, although Pub Quiz is designed to be a challenging game for all ages and skill levels. Maybe recruit some fellow quizzers to help you out?\n\nHow do I hear the answers again?\nJust ask Alexa to repeat the answers. If you are a member of my premium pub quiz group you can get the answers to your bonus questions repeated by saying \"Alexa, repeat the answers to the bonus questions\"\n\nHow do i set up a Routine?\nTo create a Routine in the Alexa app on your mobile device: Go to the menu and select Routines. Select the + icon in the top right corner. Select When This Happens, and then choose how to trigger the Routine (schedule would be recommended if you want to do it at a weekly time). Then select Add action and scroll down to Skills and then select 'your skills' and find Pub Quiz from the list of skills you have enabled.\n\n\nFEEDBACK:\n\nPositive feedback? Top stuff! Hit that review button and write a review telling me what you liked. It will make my day and give me the energy to keep making more content for the skill :)\n\nNegative feedback? GET OUT MY PUB! \nJoke... I will do my best to fix the issue.
