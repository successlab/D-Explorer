Listen up recruit, this is your first day of basic training, lets not make it your last. First a little history, the red country got offended, when the leader of the blue country, put their feet up on the red country\\u0027s leaders desk, and then all hell broke loose. I am not political, but they had it coming. Now, here\\u0027s the situation, the battlefield is divided in half down the middle by that big wall, over there, covered in razor wire. We cant see the enemy positions, and they cant see ours. But we can hear them when they fire mortars at us, and they can hear us when we fire mortars at them. Look at me when I am talking to you recruit! You are armed with a mortar, which can hit enemy players over the fence. You can either shoot, or move. The longer you sit in one place, shooting, the more likely they will hear you, and shoot back. Your armor will allow you to take up to 3 hits, after that, we will do our best to patch you up at the aid station, and get you back into the battle. As you wound, or kill enemy soldiers you will gain experience, which will help you level your rank up from, private, to sergeant, to lieutenant and beyond. Special medals can be earned by hitting multiple targets with one shot, or hitting high ranking targets. My suggestion is shoot, then move. Here is your mortar, I will leave you on space p 10. Try not to die right away.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
