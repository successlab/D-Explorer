You are invited to speak to Alexa, a sentence at a time, about anything you want. A story, your feelings, your plans, whatever. At the end of each sentence, Sentiment Sweep scores your sentiment using four different sentiment boffins. If I\u2019m not sure what you said, I\u2019ll ask you to say, redo, and you can say it again with a shorter sentence. If you need a prompt, say 'prompt'. After you say 'The End', Sentiment Sweep will give a summary.\n\nSentiment Sweep is built using the following sentiment analysis APIs:\nAmazon Comprehend\nMicrosoft Azure\nParallelDots\nExpert.ai", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
