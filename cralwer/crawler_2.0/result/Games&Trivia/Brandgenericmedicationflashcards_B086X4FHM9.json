This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: pharmacy flashcards\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 6", "des": "Pretty simple flashcard game. Alexa will name a generic or brand medication, and you respond with the corresponding brand or generic. Upon launching the skill, you can choose if you'd like to be use the hospital deck, the retail deck, or both decks. You can say something like \"test me using the hospital deck\" or \"retail deck\".\n\nI tried to include most of the \"topish\" drugs. However Alexa had trouble \"mapping\" many of the multi-word, multi-syllable drugs like ethinyl estradiol etonogestrel, so I unfortunately had to exclude some medications like those.\n\nI also attempted to correct many of Alexa's more egregious mispronunciations. For instance, she understandably pronounces Versed (midazolam) as versed, as in the sentence: \"You're well versed in drug names, but not so much in drug pronunciations.\" Cerebyx and Rocephin were also way off - I attempted to correct those and some others I don't recall at the moment.\n\nSome of other options besides just answering the flashcard - you can ask to be shown only generic drugs or only brand name drugs - if you'd like to focus on one or the other - by saying, \"switch to studying only generic drugs\" or \"can you test me on only brand drugs\" etc.\n\nYou can have Alexa repeat the medication by saying \"repeat\" or \"what was that\" or \"what drug did you say\" etc. You can clear your history by saying, \"Clear my history\" or \"delete my stats\" if you're embarrassed of your score and would like a fresh start. You can skip a question by saying \"skip\" or \"pass\".\n\nYou can say \"I don't know\" if you don't know the answer. But keep in mind, this will always be treated as a wrong answer. You can also purchase the expansion pack which gives you access to about two hundred more drugs.\n\nThis skill does support devices with display functionality like the Echo Show.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
