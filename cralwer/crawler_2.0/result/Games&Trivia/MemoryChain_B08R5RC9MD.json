This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: memory chain", "reviewnum": " 7", "des": "Memory chain is a fun game that you can play with your friends. Chain words each turn and see how far you can get. Every player needs to recite the sequence in order and record a word to add to the chain. It only ends when there is one player remaining who has the sharpest memory.\n\nStart the game by saying \"A game of 2\". Memory chain supports as many players as you want. You can always ask the game for the rules by saying \"Rules\". The help command reminds the player whose turn is it. You can interact with memory chain in the following ways:\n- Alexa, launch memory chain\n -------------> a game of 2 --------------> record hello\n- Alexa launch memory chain and ask a game of 2\n\nRecord only works with a single word. Each turn player's can record only one word. Check takes a list of words. So, say something like Check hello world to validate the entire sequence. If you take a pause long enough, your sequence will be saved. Memory chain will let you know the last recorded word and you can continue the validation by saying Check followed by the rest of the words. Your score gets saved to the leaderboard after every game. Say leaderboards to check your standing. A weekly competition is held so make sure to chain as much as you can.\n\nYou can also save your progress anytime by saying save.\n\nLogo credits: Smashicons from www.flaticon.com", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
