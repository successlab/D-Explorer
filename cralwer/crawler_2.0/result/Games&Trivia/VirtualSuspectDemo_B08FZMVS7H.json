It is not meant to be a fully fleshed out game and is only made available for demonstration purposes.\n\nThe Virtual Suspect is an autonomous agent that is filling the role of a suspect in a police interrogation. He committed a crime, and you must ask him questions about his story to uncover the truth.\n\nBefore interrogating the Virtual Suspect, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the case by reading the following document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fLmwlODrWwCj-fKYrzdj9xXMwXVt9U2qY7ZSw8JDmxM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTo start the interaction with the Virtual Suspect, simply say \"Alexa, open Virtual Suspect\" and then you can directly ask the agent questions about his story. The agent's capabilities are somewhat limited, and it's best to be as direct as possible and to stick to questions about the story itself.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
