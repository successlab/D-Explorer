This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: the great expedition", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "\u26f0\ufe0f In 'The Great Expedition' you start in London at the turn of the century. The Royal Exploration Society has tasked you to find long lost artifacts, rare animals and priceless works of art. You will need to mount expeditions to far corners of the world. \n\n\u26f0\ufe0f Fortunately for you, you have already some competent companions and helpful items at your disposal. However, you cannot take everything with you on an expedition at the beginning. Your points in leadership determine how many companions you can take with you. The same goes for knowledge and your items. Lastly, there is morale which determines how long you can motivate your crew on an expedition. Should morale drop to 0, your crew will mutiny.\n\n\u26f0\ufe0f Expeditions are essentially 'Choose your own adventure stories'. Meaning, during your expeditions you often have multiple options and you will need to decide which to pursue. Note that different characters and items might unlock new options.\n\n\u26f0\ufe0f Successful expeditions can unlock new characters, items, and even new locations. Returning rare animals and treasures will also earn prestige with the Royal Exploration Society.\n\n\n###### Things to do ######\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"Start an expedition\", then select the location, your crew and items. You can ask \"Where can I go\" and \"Who is available\" and \"What items are available\" in case you forget. \n\u26f0\ufe0f during an expedition you can say \"What are my options\" if it is unclear what you can do\n\u26f0\ufe0f you can also \"Cancel the expedition\" if you really need to\n\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"List my items\", \"List my companions\"\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"Tell me more about XYZ\", which can be a character or item\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"Tell me more about my character\", if you want to know about your stats\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"What have I found so far\" or \"How high is my prestige\"\n\n\u26f0\ufe0f \"Tell me the introduction again\", in case you need to hear it again later \n\u26f0\ufe0f \"Reset my progress\" to start from scratch, note that the initial characters and items are random and might be different from your previous play\n\n###### NOTICE ######\nThe skill is in active development and currently features only two regions 'The Arctic' and 'The Jungles of Borneo\" with a few expedition each.\n\n\n\nBackgrounds from Unsplash.com.
