During the game, you will hear a 30 second song sample and you'll have the opportunity to guess the song's title and artist. By default, you will have access to a variety of premade playlists, all of which are listed below, or by asking \"Alexa, what are the available playlists?\" If you have a Spotify account, you can gain access to additional playlists by linking your Spotify account to What's that Song. You may switch to any available playlist by saying \"Alexa, switch playlist\".\n\nTo get started, say \"Alexa, open playlist trivia\".\n\nThe scoring works as follows:\n- 3 points for the correct song name\n- 2 points for the correct artist name\n\nPremade Playlists:\n- DailyJams\n- Today's Top Hits\n- Pop Rising\n- All Out 10s\n- All Out 00s\n- All Out 90s\n- Classic Oldies\n- Rap Caviar\n- Film & TV Favorites\n\nSpecial Thanks to Tomorrow Daily for putting together the DailyJams playlist.
