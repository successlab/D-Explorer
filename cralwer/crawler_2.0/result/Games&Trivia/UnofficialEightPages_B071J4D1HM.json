Alexa is the only one who has survived this game. She knows the forest very well and can go along with you in this scary adventure.\n\nYou can move north, south, west, east or back, to go from one place to another at a time while you listen to the dark night sounds. The more pages you collect the creepier the sounds will turn. When you get on a new place ask Alexa to turn around it, there could be 4 different spots in the same place where the page could be. Remember, the more you spend finding the pages, the closest the creature will come. You have to be super fast to get the 8 pages and win the game.\n\nYou can always ask Alexa which pages you have collected, which ones you have remaining, where you are at the moment, instructions on where to go and how much time you have been so far in the forest.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
