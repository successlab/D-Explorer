Difficulty increases with the number of registered buttons. The game principle is easy. Alexa asks for a color and shows the registered buttons or the virtual buttons on the screen in different colors where only one is the correct one.\n\nThe following In-Skill products are available for purchase to extend the game with additional colors:\n\n- Color Package 1: violet, orange, white, turquoise\n- Color Package 2: pink, lime, gold, lavender, coral\n\nThe game continues to run until it is stopped with the voice command \"Alexa, stop\".\n\nNote:\n========\nEcho Buttons are not supported on FireTV Stick. The colors are chosen directly on the screen with the help of the remote control.\n\n\nIf there are any problems, crashes or questions send a feedback to the developer!\n\n\nAvailable voice commands:\n==============================================\n\n* Alexa, start learning colors\n* Alexa, start learning colors and play on screen\n* Alexa, start learning colors and play without buttons", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
