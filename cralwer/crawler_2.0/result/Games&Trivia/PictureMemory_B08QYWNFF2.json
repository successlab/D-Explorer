For example, a new picture has been added or an existing one is hidden behind a question mark...\n\nBesides 3 levels of difficulty, there is also the new \"Infinity Mode\" as an exiting premium content, which has no fixed number of rounds, gets more and more difficult, and only ends when you have made two mistakes. Additionally, this new mode also includes a high score with which you can challenge yourself or your friends and family!\n\n\nWe would be very happy if you could take the time to rate this skill.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
