This is a brand new feature that allows you to have a personal game master watching over you, offering you contextual hints when you ask for them. This is a premium feature that can be accessed by joining the Escape Club (much cheaper than a real escape room!). \nYou are trapped in a room. It's up to you and only you to escape. Search your room, pick up items, and solve puzzles to find your way out. There are five rooms to choose from and more being added. \n\nThe rooms in relative order of difficulty are:\nJail Cell - Easiest\nOffice - Medium\nCar - Hard\nGarage - Hard (Premium) \nSpaceship - (Premium Multi-Level) \nAirplane - (Premium, Three Rooms in One!)\n\nTo play the game you have three basic actions (plus some more contextual commands you'll find out in the game) Sticking to these commands is the key to having the game work smoothly:\nLook {Direction} ----------------- e.g. Look left\nInspect/Look at/use {Object} ----- e.g. Inspect the motorcycle\nUse {Item} on {Object} ----------- e.g. Use the key on the safe\n\nGet new Hint --------------------- Gets you the next hint\nRepeat Hints --------------------- Repeats the hints you heard\n\nOther useful commands are:\nHelp - can remind you what you can do at that point in time\nInventory - reminds you what items you have\n\n*Once you master the commands it is important to note that once alexa starts speaking, you can just say, \"Alexa\", and then your next command, without waiting for her to finish speaking. This is very useful when you are exploring through parts of the room that you have seen already and don't need to wait for the full descriptions again*\n\nIf you happen to get stuck, don't worry. It is a pretty hard game to solve. Think about all the clues you have and all the items you have picked up. If you still can't seem to solve the rooms don't be discouraged. We offer walkthroughs for each of the rooms which you can refer to help you escape!\n\nWalkthroughs:\nFREE -Jail Cell: https://www.stokedskills.com/jailcell.html\nFREE - Office: https://www.stokedskills.com/office.html\nFREE - Car: https://www.stokedskills.com/car.html\n\nPlease leave a review if you like the game. We really appreciate it and it help encourage us to keep working on more great skills for you.
