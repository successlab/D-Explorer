It offers you a chance to interact, learn about and understand some of the skills and techniques you might need in order for your body and mind to survive emergency situations.\n\nPREPPERS: THE GAME is made by Casson & Friends, it's free to play and offers you two distinct routes through the game; you make a choice about which route to follow at the beginning (we recommend experiencing both as they are very different) as one route focuses more on prepping which happen inside in a single place and the other on survivalism and being outdoors. Each route is structured into three acts, so if you wanted to, you could pause at the end of each act or play all the way through.\n\nFind out more at cassonandfriends.com/preppersgame", "priv": ""}
