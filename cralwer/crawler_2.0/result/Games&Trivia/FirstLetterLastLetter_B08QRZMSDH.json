Then the next person says another word in the category, but there is a catch, every new word must start with the last letter of the previous word. If the timer is reached without a correct word being said, that player loses a point.\n\nPlay until you run out of words or want to change the category.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
