This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: zombie racing", "reviewnum": " 722", "des": "So you want more information on zombie racing... Well you have come to the right place. Alexa hosts the biggest and best zombie races in the business and provides world class commentary for the races.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\nOnly zombies can race, so you will have to choose which Zombie you think will win the race. \nFour zombies will be racing. If you pick the winner, then you will win zombie boogers. \nZombie boogers sound disgusting but they are more valuable than gold or any cryptocurrency in the world (joke).\nThe most likely zombie to win the race will probably return the fewest boogers and least likely to win will most likely return the most boogers. But zombie racing is a very unpredictable sport.\n\nWHAT'S THE POINT:\nZombie Boogers! Show off how many Zombie Boogers you have on the oogie boogie zombie boogers leaderboard. Climb the ranks and become the ultimate Zombie Racing Champion!\n\nHOW DO I SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL SPORT:\nGreat question! You can see the full glory of this sport on Alexa screen based devices that support the latest update. But the commentary does the sport justice and the sounds of a zombie race are better than ice cream.\n\nI WANT TO PLAY ALL DAY:\nwow wow wow. It looks like we have a bit of a zombie racing legend here. I'm afraid Zombie Racing is currently limited to being played every 3 hours... unless you buy unlimited zombie racing. Open the game again after your first free game and you should be able to unlock unlimited zombie racing.\n\nHOW DO I UNLOCK MORE ZOMBIES:\nShhh unlocking zombies is a bit of secret. But when you win zombie boogers you will unlock more zombies. \nMore zombie boogers = more zombies unlocked. \nWhen you unlock a zombie it does not mean it will race in the next race. But eventually it will race if you have unlocked it.\n\nWHO MADE THIS WIERD, DISGUSTING BUT AMAZING GAME:\nhugo.fm - I make loads of fun alexa skills. You may like one of these:\n\"Alexa, enable Big Fart\" - \"Alexa, Open Big Fart\" \n\"Alexa, enable Number Tennis\" - \"Alexa, Open Number Tennis\" \n\nWHAT IS THAT INCREDIBLE ZOMBIE SONG:\nThat is \"Do the zombie\" By HUGO F M \n I came up with the song as a bit of a laugh while while making the game. I hope you like it.\n\nHOW CAN I SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THE GAME:\nHit the review button and tell me what you like.\n\nHOW CAN I GET IN CONTACT:\nIf it is a way to improve the game then please get in contact. \nhugo.fm/contact\n\nTELL ME MORE:\nThe game is a bit like horse racing, but instead of lovely, quiet, beautiful horses, you have savage, disgusting, ugly, noisy zombies. The zombies are known to have weaknesses that will slow them down in the race and most of the time zombies won't even finish the race. but don't worry the expert zombie doctors will be able to patch up a decapitated head in time for the next race. The zombies are always keen to race as the winning zombie gets a nice plate of juicy brains.\n\nEnjoy the game and thanks for giving it a go.\nHugo\n\nRemember: Just like puppies are not just for Christmas. This zombie racing game isn't just for halloween.\n\nDisclaimer: This description is very tongue in cheek and obviously zombie boogers and not worth anything but a huge amount of respect from me and fellow zombie racers.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
