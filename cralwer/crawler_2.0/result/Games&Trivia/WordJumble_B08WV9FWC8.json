You will have three turns to guess the word. Each turn, you can either try to guess the word, or if you don't know the word yet, you can say \"jumble\" to mix up the letters again! You can also say, \"I give up,\" if you want to move to the next word.\n\nAlexa will keep track of your wins and losses and summarize your results at the end of the session. \n\nTo begin the fun, simply say, \"Alexa, open Word Jumble!\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
