This % represents how much of the full distance the player can expect from a shot, due to the reduced conditions of the ball lie. This skill will take two input numbers from the user - the percentage and the actual distance to the target. The result output from Alexa is a new target distance, which exceeds the actual distance by a calculated amount such that the resulting shot should end up traveling the correct distance to the actual hole. E.g. A lie percentage of 80 at an actual distance of 100 yards will yield an Alexa output target of 125 yards (because 80% of the targeted 125 yards will result in a shot that travels 100 yards).", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
