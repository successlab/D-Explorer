Will you win a car or be stuck with a goat? There's only one way to find out!\n\nTo start a game, open 'Monty Hall' and wait for Alexa's response.\n \nThis follows the same basic game principle as the classic statics problem. The game goes as follows: \nThe player selects a door.\nThe host selects a different door and opens it.\nThe host gives the player the option of switching from her original choice to the remaining closed door.\nThe door finally selected by the player is opened and she either wins or loses.\n\nWill you keep your door and test your luck at that other door? Or risk the consequence of being stuck with a goat! \n\n**DISCLAIMER** \nNo actual goats were harmed in the making of this skill.\nNo actual cars can be won while playing this game. \nThis was strictly a learning experience to develop my own Amazon Alexa skill,", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
