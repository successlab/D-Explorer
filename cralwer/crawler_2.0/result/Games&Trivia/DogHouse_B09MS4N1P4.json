Return to your Dog House to earn treats, and feed them to your dogs to teach them new barks. \n\nUsers in the United States can get Dog House Gold, which expands how many dogs you can keep. Gold members also can adopt more dog breeds, such Corgis, Bulldogs, and Retrievers.\n\nFor those that just want to hear bark sounds, say \"Barks only\" to pause adopting dogs. Any dogs you already adopted will be saved for later, and can be visited again. Just keep playing and you will be asked to start collecting again.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
