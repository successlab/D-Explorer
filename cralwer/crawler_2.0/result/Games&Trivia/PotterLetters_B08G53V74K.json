This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: potter letters", "reviewnum": " 80", "des": "You and Alexa take turns guessing Potter related names or phrases beginning with a selected letter of the alphabet.\n\nThere are lots of sound effects and surprises.\n\nAlexa will tell you when it's your turn. If you don't answer, Alexa will prompt you to respond for a second time. If you still fail to answer then the game will time out.\n\nIf you can't think of an answer you can say \"Don't know\". If that happens Alexa will win the game but she will also suggest answers you could have given so you can learn for future games.\n\nYou can select which letter to play by saying \u201cAlexa, Play Letter\" (then your chosen letter). For example \u201cAlexa, Play Letter F\u201d or \u201cAlexa, Play Letter W\u201d.\n\nPotter Letters doesn\u2019t support the letters: X, Y and Z, as there are so few answers starting with those letters.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPotter Letters Grading System:\n--------------------------------------\n\u2022 3 answers in a row - Merely Muggle\n\u2022 5 answers in a row - Pitifully Pettigrew\n\u2022 10 answers in a row - Dutifully Dobby\n\u2022 15 answers in a row - Fantastically Fred\n\u2022 20 answers in a row - Seriously Snape\n\u2022 25 answers in a row - Exceeds Expectations\n\u2022 30 answers in a row - Outstanding\n\u2022 35 answers in a row \u2013 Order of Merlin\n\u2022 40 answers in a row \u2013 Order of the Phoenix\n\u2022 45 answers in a row \u2013 JK Rowling\n\nRules:\n---------\n1. A \u201cthe\u201d in a title is treated as invisible. So \u201cThe Leaky Cauldron\u201d is a correct answer for the letter \u201cL\u201d, not the letter \u201cT\u201d.\n\n2. An \u201cA\u201d or an \u201cAn\u201d in a title are NOT invisible. So \u201cA Beginners Guide to Transfiguration\u201d is a correct answer for the letter \u201cA\u201d, not the letter \u201cB\u201d. \n\n3. If you say the full name then the first name takes precedence. So \u201cFleur Delacour\u201d is a correct answer for the letter \u201cF\u201d, not the letter \u201cD\u201d. \n\n4. First names and surnames ARE allowed as separate answers. For surnames please use the surname at the time of the books \u2013 so it\u2019s Ginny Weasley and not Ginny Potter, etc.\n\n5. If you say just the FIRST name then the answer is taken as the FULL name - so \u201cFlorean\u201d is taken as \u201cFlorean Fortescue\u201d. Thus you can\u2019t give \u201cFlorean\u201d AND \u201cFlorean Fortescue\u201d as 2 separate answers - they are treated as the SAME answer. \n\nLeader Board Frequently Asked Questions.\n--------------------------------------------------\nQ \u2013 Do the scores and ranks on the Leader Board include every Potter Letters player in the world?\nA \u2013 Yes. The Leader Board is a Global Leader Board, covering ALL Potter Letters players, wherever they are in the world.\n\nQ \u2013 Is the Leader Board real time?\nA \u2013 Yes. The Leader Board is updated continuously, in real time, so you always get the latest information.\n\nQ - Even though I won a game, my rank stayed the same, or went down! How is that even possible?\nA \u2013 This can happen if players above you break away from sharing their score with other players. For example, let\u2019s say 2 players above you on the Leader Board share the same score. They will be in joint place. However, if one of them increases their score then they will no longer share a score and instead of there being just one joint place above you there will be 2 separate places above you, and so you\u2019ll be pushed down the rankings.\n\nMissing answers?\n--------------------\nI am certain that not every possible answer is included in Potter Letters.\nSo please accept my apologies if your guess is not present.\nBut I hope you\u2019ll still enjoy the game!\n\nFeedback\n-------------\nI hope you\u2019ll love Potter Letters.
