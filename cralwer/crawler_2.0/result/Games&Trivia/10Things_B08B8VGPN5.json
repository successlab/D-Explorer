It then cuts each down to the first sentence, which is typically the most informative as to what a given person/thing/place etc. can be described as. The logic eliminates category pages, redirects and other special pages, so you should get ten straightforward declarative statements. Because the \"things\" are drawn at random from the entire body of human knowledge, it is hit or miss whether each is especially interesting or useful. Still, opening this skill once or twice a day is a nice distraction. Every now and then, you hit on something really interesting and wind up down a rabbit hole of research. It's fun!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
