The objective of the game is to clear the board by jumping marbles over each other, removing the marble that was jumped over. The game starts with a board full of marbles, except for the center spot, which is empty. You can move a marble horizontally or vertically by jumping over an adjacent marble into an empty space. The jumped marble is then removed from the board.\n\nThe goal is to be left with only one marble on the board. Plan your moves carefully and see if you can clear the board. If you make a mistake, you can restart the game and try again.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you launch this skill, it will tell you to open Puzzle Games.\n\nHUGO FM", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
