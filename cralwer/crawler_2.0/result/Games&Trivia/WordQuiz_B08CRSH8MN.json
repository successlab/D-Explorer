This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: word quiz", "reviewnum": " 37", "des": "Word Quiz is an entertaining game for you and your friends. Alexa gives you up to 5 clues and you can try to guess the solution after each one. The less clues you need, the more points you score. The words and terms are from different categories, like people, TV, entertainment, things, internet. \nFor very good or bad answers Alexa will react accordingly. But she will also help you, if you are close to the solution. By the way, you can also score points by accidentally guessing clue words before they were given.\n\nIf you have no idea after a clue, just say \"next\" and receive the next clue. If a searched term is too difficult to guess despite all clues, you can continue with \"next term\" and learn the solution.\n\nYou have got 8 seconds to give any answer (enforced by Amazon, cannot be changed). If you need more time to think, say \"repeat\" before the time is up. Then you will get another 8 seconds.\n\nOn a device with display like Echo Spot or Echo Show you can see the clues and further hints.\n\nYou're welcome to give us feedback regarding the skill via mail to fa-software@gmx-topmail.de. We are open to suggestions, criticism or praise. Thank you!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
