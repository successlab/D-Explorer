This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: zener cards", "reviewnum": " 7", "des": "Are You Psychic? Test your extra sensory perception (ESP), primarily clairvoyance with the Zener Card Psychic Test, or use regularly to develop your psychic and clairvoyant skills. \n\nOnce you launch the Zener Card Psychic Test, you\u2019ll be greeted by parapsychologist Dr. Clair Voyant, who will be your coach and will offer you tips to keep you focused. Zener cards are presented in various two to five card spreads. \n\nYour challenge is to quickly predict what symbol the hidden card is; square, circle, star, waves, or cross. Once you state your answer, Dr. Clair will reveal the card and award you points. After you play five consecutive spreads, you\u2019ll receive a score. Dr. Clair will also keep track of your High Score inspiring you to exceed it!\n\nIf you are dedicated to developing your ESP and clairvoyance, try these pro tips:\n\n1. If you\u2019re playing on an Amazon Dot device without a screen, grab a few index cards and sketch out the symbols; star, waves, cross, circle and square. This will help you quickly predict what the hidden Zener card is. \n2. Take a few moments to relax and clear your mind before selecting a shape to increase your ability to concentrate. \n3. Study each symbol to get a feeling about the symbol. Can you see the next shape in your mind\u2019s eye? Or maybe the word of the symbol pops into your head. \nThe odds of guessing a card by chance is 1 in 5. For a thorough assessment of psychic ability, one should take the test at least 10 times for conclusive results.\n\nAny time you need a little help within the skill, just say \u201cHelp\u201d for guidance.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot is good for voice only participation. Echo Show devices with LCD screens takes you beyond the voice only experience where you can visually interact with Dr. Clair Voyant and enjoy beautiful graphics.\n\nWHAT\u2019S COMING SOON\nIn the coming weeks, you\u2019ll be able to access a more challenging phase of Zener Card Psychic Testing through subscription. You will also have the option to set-up reminders to end or start the day with the \u201d Zener Card Psychic Test\u201d skill every day, for example at 8:00 PM or breakfast time..\n\n\nNOTE: The information in this skill is provided for entertainment purposes only.\n\nFEEDBACK\nTo send us feedback or ask questions, email us! support@studiocarlton.com\nFollow us on Instagram: Instagram.com/ZenerCards\n\nSTUDIO CARLTON\nStudio Carlton team is an awesome group of visionaries who are passionate about producing high-quality, interactive Alexa Skills from concept to delivery to make it easier for business owners, professionals, authors to converse with their audience on Amazon Alexa.
