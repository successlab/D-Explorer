If you can't think of any animals with A, you can say \"pass\" or say \"give me a hint\".\nIf you pass, you move on to the next category without earning any points.\nIf, on the other hand, you can answer with a correct word, for example \"alligator\", you will earn 6 points, or 12 points if this is the first time you use this word.\n\nHave fun!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
