Choose how much you want to spend on marketing. Each of your choices can be of 3 different qualities: low, average or high.\nAfter you design it, you will hear the review of the phone you built along with how the people reacted to it's release.\nRemember, building a budget phone is slightly tricky. Having high quality is good, but it will raise the cost of the phone which will make people less likely to buy. On the other hand, build everything cheap may make people buy more initially, but bad reviews can spread fast and flop your phone soon.", "priv": ""}
