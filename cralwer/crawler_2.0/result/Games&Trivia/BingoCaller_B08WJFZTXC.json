Bingo cards can be printed or purchased from many sources online.\n\nThe game uses standard Bingo cards with columns labeled \"B\", \"I\", \"N\", \"G\", and \"O\" from left to right. The \"B\" column should contain numbers between 1 and 15, the \"I\" column should contain numbers between 16 and 30, the \"N\" column should contain numbers between 31 and 45, the \"G\" column should contain numbers between 46 and 60, and the \"O\" column should contain numbers between 61 and 75.\n\nOnce you launch the skill, Alexa will serve as your Bingo caller! Mark your cards as the numbers are called. When you have a complete row, call out, \"Alexa, Bingo!\"\n\nIt is the same game of Bingo that everyone knows and loves, except Alexa is running the show!\n\nOnce you are ready to play, just say, \"Alexa, open Bingo Caller!\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
