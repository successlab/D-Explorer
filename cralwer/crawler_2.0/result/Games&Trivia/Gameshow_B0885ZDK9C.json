Players will buzz in with their Echo Buttons to answer. As you play, Alexa will let you know if you're right or wrong and track your score\n \nWhile playing, you can say \"Alexa, repeat that\" to hear Alexa read the question again. You can also say, \"Alexa, what are the scores?\" to hear a score report. You can say, \"Alexa, help!\" to hear about what you can do next. You can say, \"Alexa, start over\" if you want to abandon the current game and pick up from the beginning. At any time you can say, \"Alexa, stop\" to halt the current game.
