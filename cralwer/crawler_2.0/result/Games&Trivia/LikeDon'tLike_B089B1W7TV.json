You start with 100 points. You have to say what you like and what you don't like that matches the examples. \n\nYou start with one example, and if you need more examples, say \"another example\". Each additional example costs 5 points. You can repeat all the examples for free. Each time you don't match the example costs 5 points. If you get a wrong answer, I'll offer you a hint. That will cost you 5 points. You can ask for a Crazy Clue at any time, but it'll cost you 30 points. If you get three answers in a row right you can collect your points and play another round. After getting three in a row, you can say \"stop\" to leave the game and post your score, or say \"keep playing\" to rack up more points. If your score drops to zero, you bust, and the game is over.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
