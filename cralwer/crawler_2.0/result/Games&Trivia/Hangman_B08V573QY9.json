You will guess letters and she will tell you if they are in the word. Each time you guess a letter that is not in the word, she will draw a part of the hanging man. After you miss six letters, the drawing will be complete and you lose. If you can guess all of the letters before then, you win. At any time, you can also say, \"solve,\" to try to solve the word.\n\nTo begin playing, simply say, \"Alexa, open Hangman.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
