Want to live dangerously? Well, just a little bit? This skill will generate a three-word meaningless phrase from three digits that you speak to it. The challenge is that, if you choose to try this out, then you must promise to include the resulting meaningless phrase in your review of the book. The question is: will anyone notice? Will it be accepted? The chance of exposure is small, but it is not zero. It's up to you to find the best place to hide the phrase you are given. Now, go for it! Think of a three-digit number. Speak your three digits clearly, with a phrase like \"Alexa, ask publishers book review to use two zero three.\" There is no personal data involved in this skill.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
