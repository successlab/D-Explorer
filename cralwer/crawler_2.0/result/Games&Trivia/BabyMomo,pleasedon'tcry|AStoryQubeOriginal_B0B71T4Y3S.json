He bursts out crying whenever he listens to any sound that is foreign to him, any sound he hasn't heard before. \n\nThe only way to make him stop crying and get back to cute giggling that fills our hearts with love, is to say Baby Momo, please don't cry, It is just Thunder, or It is just a car, or It is just a cat depending on what new sound he just heard. \n\nSo identify the sounds and make sure Baby Momo stops crying!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
