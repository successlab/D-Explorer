Train your brain as you search for the perfect sequence of cards, or just relax and enjoy the fun!\n\nIt's easy to play, but hard to master! The rules are simple:\n\u25c6 Your goal is to move as many cards as you can from the top of the board to the bottom before your deck runs out!\n\u25c6 You can only pick a card if it is one higher or one lower than the card you currently have.\n\nThat's it! And once you've cleared the board once, see if you can clear the board in fewer moves! Go for the longest streak you can!\n\nFEEDBACK\nThis is a public early access beta test, and we have ton of features still to come, thanks for trying it out!\nEmail us at solitaire@volleythat.com if you have any issues or feedback.
