Though they may seem difficult, they are all solvable--don't be afraid to test out unusual combinations of items, pull different levers, and glean hints by observing various items in your environment.\n\nNote: though available in the tutorial, hints are not currently supported in the Nuclear Reactor scenario.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
