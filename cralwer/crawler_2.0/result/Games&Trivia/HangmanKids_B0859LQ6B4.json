The game where Alexa thinks of a word and children and adults try to guess it by suggesting letters. \n\n\u25cf Hangman Kids is a pedagogical game where your kids will learn to spell in a pleasant and simple way, thus developing logic and reflection.\n\n\u25a0 How doy you play? It is super easy. Just say \"Alexa\" and a letter. For example :\n- \"Alexa, A\"\n- \"Alexa an A\"\n- \"Alexa, letter A\"\n\n\u25cf If the kids get stuck, the game will provide hints and jokers to guess the secret word. Just say: \n- \"Alexa, joker\". Use jokers to display a letter without revealing the whole word.\n- \"Alexa, hint\". Kids will have the possibility to ask for hints, only once per word.\n\n\u25cf Conclusively, Hangman Kids is a truly complete game for the cognitive development of our children also without any doubt that will make them and the elders nearby have a good time.\n\n\u25bc Please, leave us your opinion, suggestions for new categories, or improvements.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the game and help us improve it.\nMany thanks from the Escenit Games team!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
