Its why I wrote this skill. It will lead you through the rounds of play and keep track of your scores until one of the players wins the game. It will tell you the value of melds and what is the next step in the round that you are in. I have been playing pinochle for about 63 years and have picked up a few \"house\" rules. I am sure you will enjoy them.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
