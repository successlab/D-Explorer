Because this is live, huge moments of silence will occur especially when you get past midnight Eastern standard time. The majority of the people who are on this particular system are on the East Coast and will be sleeping during that time. it will be almost undoubtedly silent. Do keep that in mind when you are listening. The best times to tune in to the talk box is during regular morning afternoon and evening hours. Past midnight, though you may not hear anything, but rest assured, the stream is still working, it is very much alive, and very much well. Just ask your Amazon Alexa device to launch the American talk box and you will hear a short ad and the stream will come on and again, if there\u2019s silence, you will hear nothing after the ad. However, should there be activity then you will begin to hear that about one second after the ad is played. I hope you enjoy this live feed set up by volunteers And ran by said volunteers. This skill was made with love in Jesus Christ\u2019s mighty name.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
