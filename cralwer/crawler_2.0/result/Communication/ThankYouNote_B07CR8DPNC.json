Once you're done, you can start over fresh and you're just a few seconds away from your next thank you note!\n\nOf course the note will also display within your Alexa app or on the screen of your Alexa Show or your other Alexa enabled devices.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
