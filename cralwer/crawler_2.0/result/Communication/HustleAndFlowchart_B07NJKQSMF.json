We learn their stories and the lessons learned before diving in and getting the real \"meat.\" Every single show has actionable takeaways that listeners can implement in their own life or business. We focus on topics around traffic, brand awareness, and business systematization but have been known to go pretty \"off script\" from time to time to discuss a wide variety of topics to help people improve their lives.\n\nHere are a few quick tips when navigating our skill. The First thing to note, when opening the skill you\u2019ll be playing the latest episode, but if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for, you can always find something more specific. This skill allows you to play next or previous episode. In addition, you can ask the skill to play the newest or oldest episodes or if you want to get specific, play a specific episode by saying the episode number. Try some of these commands:\n\n**Next/Previous Episode**\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, next\u201d\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, previous\u201d\n\n**Select Latest Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask Hustle Flowchart Podcast to play latest episode\u201d \n\n**Select First Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask Hustle Flowchart Podcast to start from first episode\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
