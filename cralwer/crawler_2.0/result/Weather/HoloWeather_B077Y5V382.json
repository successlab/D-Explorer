Different visual effects represent each form of weather, time of day, etc.\n\nThe HoloPlayer One HoloWeather app can be downloaded for Mac here: http://static-files.lookingglassfactory.com.s3.amazonaws.com/HoloWeather/HoloWeather-Mac.zip\nGo here for Windows: http://static-files.lookingglassfactory.com.s3.amazonaws.com/HoloWeather/HoloWeather-Win.zip\n\nIf you need help setting up you HoloPlayer One, please follow the tutorial here: https://blog.lookingglassfactory.com/getting-started-b3a72335567d\n\nWhen you open the app, you will be prompted to enter an app ID. This ID will be provided by your Alexa when you open the skill. Enter the number into your app, press enter, and tell your Alexa you are done. If you ever need to change your app ID, or submitted it incorrectly, press the \u201c~\u201d (tilde) key on your keyboard to reopen the UI to enter the number.\n\nWith your app synced up with your Alexa, you can ask to see the weather in cities around the world. You can also switch between metric and imperial units, and ask to see the forecast for the city you are currently observing. \n\nTo issue a command to the app and then have Alexa stop listening, you can ask to open the skill with a command utterance. So, for example, \u201cAlexa, open HoloWeather for London\u201d or \u201cAlexa, open HoloWeather and switch to forecast\u201d will have the Alexa shut down immediately after fulfilling the requested command. If you just ask Alexa to open the skill by saying \u201cAlexa, open HoloWeather\u201d she will continue listening until you tell her to stop.\n\nTo see a video of this skill working on a HoloPlayer one, visit this page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPoa6urrshQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nYou can download a 2D version of the app for testing without a HoloPlayer One for Mac here: http://static-files.lookingglassfactory.com.s3.amazonaws.com/HoloWeather/HoloWeather2D-Mac.zip\nAnd for Windows here: http://static-files.lookingglassfactory.com.s3.amazonaws.com/HoloWeather/HoloWeather2D-Win.zip\n\nArt by Jeff Chang.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
