It uses the information publicly available on aqicn.org.\n\nAn air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. Is a measure that takes into account many different air quality indicators and estimates a global index. The scale is as follows:\n\n- 0-50 means that the air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.\n- 51-100 means that air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.\n- 101-150 means that members of sensitive groups may experience health effects although the general public is not likely to be affected. The cautionary statement is the same as before.\n- 150-200 means that everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.\n- 200-300 means health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected. Cautionary statement is the same as before.\n- 300+ means a health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects. Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.\n\nInfo from aqicn.org/scale/en.\n\nSkill's icon based on srip's from www.flaticon.com.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
