This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: g. box one\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Voice commands are the new black! Here's how to use them with your gBox1.\n\n1. Click the 'Enable' button.\n\n2. This will open a new browser tab or window where you will need to login into your gBox1 account to link it to your Amazon account (using OATH2.0).\n\n3. Your Amazon Alexa account is now linked to your gBox1 account. You only need to do this once! (Alexa now has a 'token' to access your gBox1 data via the gBox1 API - the same API used by your gBox1 and dashboard).\n\n4. You can now have a conversation with this skill:\n a. Try saying \"Alexa start g. box 1\". Alexa will acknowledge and read out your gBox1 serial number.\n b. Now that the skill is started you can ask Alexa to \"Read channel xxx\" where xxx = 1 to 6\n c. And as many times as you like \"Read channel xxx\" ...\n d. When finished just say \"Bye for now\" to close off the session. Alexa will politely acknowledge.\n\n5. If you don't want to start up a conversation with the gBox1 skill and only want to query one channel value you can simply say \"Alexa ask g. box 1 to read channel xxx\" at any time. This is known as a 'single interaction' rather than 'conversational'.\n\n6. It's all pretty cool but very basic for now. I'll add more functionality over time.\n\nEnjoy,\nChris.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
