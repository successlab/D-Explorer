Symptoms may be severe in some sufferers. These days typically occur as a result of high temperatures and/or dry, hot winds, so the best precaution is to stay indoors.\n\nVERY HIGH: Most sufferers of pollen allergies will experience symptoms on very high pollen level days. These days are typically warm and dry so the best precaution is to stay indoors away from sources of pollen.\n\nHIGH: Some sufferers of pollen allergies will experience symptoms on high pollen level days, but these are unlikely to be severe. Temperatures are likely to be warm on these days, but there may be a limiting factor such as rain or sea breezes.\n\nMODERATE: A few sufferers of pollen allergies may experience symptoms on moderate pollen level days. These are typically cooler days or days on which rain is expected to \"flush\" the pollen out of the air.\n\nLOW: Very few sufferers of pollen allergies would be expected to experience symptoms on low pollen level days. These are typically either cold or wet days when there is likely to be little pollen released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n**Feedback**:\n\nYou can email me directly at alexaozcalendar@gmail.com\n with any questions, comments or concerns.\n\nFuture releases will offer additional features based on community feedback.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
