This skill can estimate a \"star-gazing\" quality index for your location. This indicator is generated using various parameters, such as: cloud coverage, day of the week, humidity, moon phase, precipitation and son on.\n\nJust ask Alexa and you will learn:\n- How good it will be for stargazing, with a score out of 10.\n- Which constellations can you see.\n- Which planets are visible tonight.\n- The top brightest messier objects for this night.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
