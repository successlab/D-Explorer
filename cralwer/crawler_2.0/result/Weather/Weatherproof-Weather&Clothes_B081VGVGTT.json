This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: weather proof", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "No more wet clothes or unnecessary freezing/sweating: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof what to wear today\"\n\"Currently it is partly cloudy in New York with a temperature of 44 degrees Fahrenheit. For walking I recommend a cap, a scarf, a jacket, thin gloves, long pants and sturdy shoes. The max temperature is 50 degrees. You can switch then to no cap and no gloves.\"\nLet weatherproof check the weather conditions before leaving the house. A quick question, and you know the best outdoor clothing for the next few hours.\n\nRain protection: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof do I need an umbrella today\"\nSwiftly check if you should take an umbrella with you. Maybe it\u00b4s just drizzling rain, or maybe the wind is so strong that the umbrella will not work and therefore a raincoat is the best choice. This skill knows the answer!\n\nCold protection: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof is it going to be cold tomorrow?\"\nWeatherproof recommends thin or thick jackets, scarfs, caps and winter hats for cold weather, thin or thermal gloves and mittens for extreme cold conditions. It simply knows the best weatherproof combination for all conditions.\n\nUV protection: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof do I need sunscreen today?\"\nIf you underestimate the power of the sun then you may quickly get sunburned. The clouds may lower UV rays by only 10%. The skill will suggest the use of low, medium or high sunscreen according to today\u00b4s UV Index.\nYour eyes being very sensitive must also be protected with sunglasses if there\u2018s too much UV radiation.\n\nWarnings for severe weather conditions: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof what's the weather like on Monday\"\nGet official alerts for natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis for the US, Canada, European Union countries, and Israel.\n\nSelect your outdoor activity: \"Alexa, ask weatherproof what to wear now for cycling\"\nThe optimal clothing selection depends highly on your outdoor activity. If you will be partaking in exercise, then you will not freeze as quickly in comparison to standing for 30 minutes. On a bicycle, gloves are needed more often due to the chilling wind. The skill has profiles for people who tend to freeze quickly, who tend to freeze slowly or who tend to get a sunburn quickly and more frequently.\n\nThe weather report contains valuable information only\nWeatherproof will report only the most valuable information to you. If there is no wind than the wind speed is not mentioned. If humidity is high than weatherproof will warn you about it. If the felt temperature differs from the real temperature than it will be mentioned. This keeps your daily weather report slim and right to the point.\n\nImproved \"felt temperature\"\nThe clothing recommendation function can only provide good results when they use accurate temperature estimations. The \"felt temperature\" known from many weather forecasts is useful for taking wind and humidity into account and telling you how cold it will feel. However, they only consider the temperature in areas with more shade but on a day with a clear sky, you are more interested in the `felt temperature` in the sun. The skill provides this value by taking the sun\u00b4s angle and the amount of cloud cover into the equation.\n\nGet the skill now for free and never worry again about what you need to wear again!\n\nIs there a question missing you would like to be answered?
