The skill uses the data collected from those weather stations and can be set up to use data from a weather station joined in the project. You can use the data from your own weather station (if you have one) or from another weather station close to you. The only thing you need is to know the required weather station ID and to set it up by saying to Alexa \"set my station ID to 581294\" (your station ID).", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
