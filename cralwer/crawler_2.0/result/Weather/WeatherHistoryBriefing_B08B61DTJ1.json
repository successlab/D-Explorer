This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "\"This Day In Weather History\" is a daily podcast by The Weather Network that features unique and informative stories from host Chris Mei. \n\nWeather Happens Everyday. It can be sunny, cloudy, stormy or maybe just unsettled, but it is always happening! It\u2019s when severe weather strikes that it captures the attention of those affected ...and the imagination of everyone else who follows the story. \n\nSo it is with good reason to expect that after over a century of news and weather information gathering and record keeping, there would be a \"special\" weather or natural phenomena event to mark each day of a calendar. \n\nDo you remember the first recorded tornado in Canadian history? No, you don\u2019t because none of us were there...so we dive into that! How about when Prince played the Super Bowl halftime show? It\u2019s possible the best performance ever for that event\u2026.and the backstory made it all the more special! \n\nOr how about the 25th Anniversary Woodstock Festival back in 1994? Bands like Green Day and Nine Inch Nails were only 2 albums into their young careers, but how they adapted to the weather conditions is what instantly made their performances not only legendary, but also catapulted them into mainstream stardom. \n\nIt\u2019s all here - all year - in one podcast.... \"This Day In Weather History\"!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
