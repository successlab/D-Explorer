Then why don't we try to combine these two together?\n\n## What it does\nSimply asking for time or weather is easy. But this skill combines these two together so that you can save some time only required to ask once.\n\n## How I built it\n1. Using some libs to get timezone for the city, and then get the local time of it;\n2. Using OpenWeatherMap API for acquiring weather data for a certain city.\n\n## Challenges I ran into\nIncorperating different sources of information together.\n\n## Accomplishments that I'm proud of\nCombinatorial is a simple ideology. But combining two highly combined can really make a change.\n\n## What's next for TimeAndWeather\nMore active form of displaying results. Support for more forms of input. Also, currently it only supports cities in US.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
