This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: bored music geek radio", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "\"Unlike most radio stations that have fewer than 100 songs in rotation over and over and over, Bored Music Geek Radio's starting point is 10,000+ songs that cross and blend genres. Music from the last 100 years is mixed in with music as new as now.\n\nYou will hear plenty of classic hits, if that's your thing, but you will also hear lots of deep cuts, obscure tracks, unsigned acts, and (in some cases) music that you will never hear anywhere else custom made for the station.\n\nBored Music Geek Radio is the perfect place for those who love going deeper into music but still enjoy the big hits, too.\n\nWe are currently in the process of adding original programming, but the staple of the station is a century's worth of music coming at you randomly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThe online radio station is located on the Live365 network which can be accessed through the internet, Bluetooth, or your smart speakers. \n\nBored Music Geek Radio will never be for everyone, but it will always be for a very certain group. Are you one of us?\n\nAren't you tired of flipping from station to station to station? Well, come to Bored Music Geek Radio, the station that changes itself.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
