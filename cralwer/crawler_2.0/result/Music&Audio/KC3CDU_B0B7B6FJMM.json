However, every 15 minutes you will hear my local weather and time of the day or night. This may also prompt my CW id to go off so, if you are concerned that the stream isn't working, I can assure you that it is. If you aren't sure, listen for 15 or so minutes and you will hear that indeed it is. Keep in mind that there's about a 2 minute delay from when things are happening live on my end to when you hear it on your device. This is because of the way streams happen online and will in no way effect your listening experience. \n So sit back with a cup of tea and enjoy my ham radio activity. \n To learn more about me, check out \n timothyclarkmusic.wordpress.com \n Made with Love in Jesus name.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
