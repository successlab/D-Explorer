Our roots go back to Philly's long-running alternative FM station Y100 (WPLY), where a new music show called Y-Not aired every sunday night from 1997 through the station's end in 2005. After the demise of Y100, program director Jim McGuinn, promotions director Josh T. Landow, and host Joey O. (amongst others) kept the spirit of the station alive online as Y100 Rocks (later Y-Rock). As of 2010, the station returned to its independent roots, morphing once again into Y-Not Radio with Landow at the helm. Through all the name changes, our mission has always remained the same: to bring you the best alternative, modern, and indie rock!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
