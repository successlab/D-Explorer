The station was founded in early 2021.\n\nVirtual Community Radio is underscored by a 24/7 \"sustaining music service\" based primarily around Light Classical music, with a little Easy Listening, Classical and Early Music to complete the mix. On top of this is a growing roster of spoken-word programming that includes drama, readings and talk shows and forms the primary focus of the station. Programmes include \"Tarot @ Teatime\", a show discussing the history of the cards and how they may be read; \"Where Have You Been?\", a show that suggests things to do and places to visit around the Second Life Grid; and \"The Magic Of The Musical\" which focuses on musical theatre from Broadway and beyond, with special guests and monthly topics.
