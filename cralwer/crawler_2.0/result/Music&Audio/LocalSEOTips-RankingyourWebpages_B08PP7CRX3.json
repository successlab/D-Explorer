Google processes each of those searches and produces results. If you want your business, your product, or your service to show up on top of those search results, you need SEO.\n\nA solid SEO strategy can bring your website from page 100 to page 1, increasing your potential reach to new customers.\nAs a small business owner, it's possible you're wondering why you even need search engine optimization (SEO). It's a valid question. With a small business that has limited time and resources, you don't want to waste time and money on a marketing strategy that won't bring you results. But SEO will bring you results. It's a marketing strategy worth your money and time.\n\nSEO includes both onsite and offsite strategies that help new customers find your business online. Our team of SEO experts in Greensboro, NC constantly research Google's ever changing algorithms-- including creating high quality content and backlinks-- to help our clients rank higher online.\n\nThe Basics are:\n\nPick a good keyword to focus on.\n\nResearch the competition.\n\nPut the keyword in your page title.\n\nPut the keyword in your header.\n\nPut the keyword in the name and alt-tag of your image.\n\nUse the keyword in the URL and in the post.\n\nGet external links.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf88 Top Strategies\n\nGoogle Maps is a fantastic method of generating web exposure and attracting local prospects. Your potential business revenue could come from residents or employees in your local area looking for your type of business or service. Google mapping is having your business show up on a Google map with a balloon-type icon that displays your business information such as name, address and number.\n\nYour business doesn\u2019t have to be brick and mortar to appear in Google maps. Any service-oriented as well as product offering business can be marketed on Google maps, such as a Real estate agent, tax preparer, plumber, electrician, loan officer, attorney, dentist or even dog walker. If you have any type of service or business to offer, then getting found on local searches is a must.\n\nSince Yellow Page usage is way down, people are turning to find local businesses online. People are searching in different ways. One example is if you\u2019re a dentist in Annapolis, and a resident of Annapolis is looking for a dentist. Typically, they may search for \u201cAnnapolis dentist\u201d or they may just enter the word \u201cdentist\u201d and their zipcode next to it, e.g. \u201cdentist 27401\u201d.\n\nGetting listed in the top rankings of Google maps takes some effort and there\u2019s no guarantee of being listed in the top rankings. Google business mapping only lists a certain number of results on the first page. For example, they may only list 5,6, or 7 Google map results, and anything above the first 5 you would have to click on the \u201csee more\u201d link.\n\n\nSo, obviously, you want to try and do everything possible to obtain as high a ranking as possible.\n\nHere are 5 Google mapping tips to help you increase your chances of getting in the top rankings of Google Maps:\n\n1. Enhance your Google profile by adding a detailed description.\n2. Add images.\n3. Add a video if possible.\n4. Optimize your Listing for certain keywords you want to be found for.\n5. Get someone to review your business.\n6. Add a coupon if possible.\n\nOur modern Local SEO is about knowing how to optimize all aspects of your website. SEO involves technical components, content, links and credibility signals, and user engagement metrics. As competition and scope increase, so does the need to be stronger in each area. \n\nSEO is a cumulative process and adds value to your website and domain when it is done properly. \n\nWe can help with any or all of the above, reach out today! \nhttp://terrypower.com\nterrypower@email.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
