This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: my calibre player", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Calibre Audio is a UK based charity providing audiobooks to people with various challenges; including sight loss, dyslexia and various physical disabilities that make reading a printed book difficult. For more information, please visit: calibreaudio.org.uk/services\n\nMy Calibre Player allows Calibre members to play their favourite audiobooks from their Alexa device. \n\nThe skill has basic functionality; allowing you to play an audiobook, pause, skip forwards and backwards, set a sleep timer, and bookmark. To search for books or browse our collection, please visit my.calibre.org.uk to add titles and manage your playlist before using the skill.\n\nTo get started, say \u201cAlexa, open My Calibre Player\u201d. Please make sure your pronunciation is clear. We recommend you emphasise the words \u201cmy \u2013 kal \u2013 uh \u2013 buh player\u201d to avoid Alexa opening a different skill, such as your calendar.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear a jingle signifying that the skill has launched. Alexa will ask if you want to continue listening to your current book. If you say \u201cYes\u201d it\u2019ll play that book from the beginning or last known bookmark. \n\nIf you say \u201cNo\u201d Alexa will list the other titles in your current playlist. You can choose another title by stating the book name and it\u2019ll begin playing that title from the beginning or last known bookmark. \n\n\nOnce your audiobook begins playing, you\u2019ll be able to use commands such as \u201cAlexa, pause/skip or skip forward/go back\u201d to navigate through the tracks. \n\n \n\nYou can also set a sleep timer by saying \"Alexa, sleep timer for X minutes\" during playback. A bookmark will be placed once Alexa closes.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve finished listening, say \"Alexa, stop\" or \"Alexa, exit\" and this will close the skill and place a bookmark where you stop.\n\n\nIf you wish to continue directly after closing, say \"Alexa, keep reading/listening\".\n\nQuestions and Support\n\nIf you have any questions or require further help, please contact our team by emailing membershipservices@calibre.org.uk, calling 01296 432339 or head to my.calibre.org.uk and submit a form by clicking on the green bug icon.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
