SEO stands for search engine optimization and its how websites and other digital properties are set up and presented to search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, Youtube and more - so that customers who do not KNOW a business or service by name, and when looking for a solution to the problem seemingly stumble across the perfect fit for them.\n\nMy story starts at the point when I felt it was my calling to offer the same energy and effort to other businesses who I thought were like me and my own business.\n\nYou may find a few seo tips in these episodes but mostly that will be by accident. \n\nMy SEO experience runs running a boutique SEO firm to being head of on page SEO division for an international SEO agency with a team. I\u2019ve worked on local business, enterprise, to e-commerce Then without warning in August 2020, the agency imploded.\n\nNow what? Was recreating an independent agency working for myself or should I approach one of the many agencies I knew to find a new position. Or was there something else?\n\nIn 2019 I produced a popular Youtube channel \u201cSEO Fight Club\u201d for Roku and Amazon Fire TV. I know that digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels of digital media like television. It was the challenge of doing it as well as getting this information out beyond the standard information outlets and around the world.\n\nIt is these non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from online marketing.\n\nBack in 2015 I was on the forefront of SEO testing with Kyle Roof. With a renewed interest in testing in early 2020, I began to think that perhaps between the TV channel development and testing that I could pioneer something that hasn't existed before.\n\nCould I really ride the seams of SEO to make what I really want instead of conforming to the only 2 options that are typically available?\n\nAs I pondered my options, it also occurred to me that there are a lot of misunderstandings about the SEO industry. It would be hard to find a more maligned profession. \n\nSo I hope by sharing my journey and ruminations to present a human face to the SEO industry - the freelance SEO, independent agency owner - will build a bridge of greater understanding between business or C suite executives and those who live and breath working to understand the search algorithm and how to not lose your mind.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
