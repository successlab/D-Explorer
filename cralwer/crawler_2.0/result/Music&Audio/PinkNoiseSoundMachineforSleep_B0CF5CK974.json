They are overlaid on top of one another to gain the benefits of both the higher frequencies typically used more for sound cancellation, and the lower frequencies which tend to be more soothing for sensitive ears. Its soothing, calming, constant tones are wonderful for helping adults and babies alike to fall and stay asleep, for study, for meditation, for managing anxiety, or for any other activities where you want to block out the world and focus solely on the task at hand. It also has incredible sound masking properties for use in distracting and noisy environments!\n\nEnjoy the Sound Machine used by over 1.3 million people every week, and tune out the world for once!\n\n[https://12hoursoundmachines.com](https://12hoursoundmachines.com/)\n\nFYI we also have Brown Noise and White Noise Sound Machines if you prefer those! Look for the skills with this same logo but that say Brown Noise or White Noise instead of Pink Noise. Or, just say \"Alexa, open Brown Noise Sound Machine\" or \"Alexa, open White Noise Sound Machine\".\n\n---\n\n***HOW TO USE***\n\nEnable this skill either by clicking the \"enable\" button above, or saying \"Alexa, open Pink Noise Sound Machine\".\n\nBy default, the Pink Noise Sound Machine will play until 1 hour time limit is reached (for the free version). To stop the Sound Machine before that say, \"Alexa, stop.\u201d To resume it again say, \"Alexa, resume.\"\n\n***SHOW YOUR SUPPORT:***\n\nIf this skill has been helpful for you, I'd be so grateful if you left a review! It actually helps a LOT to boost us on the Alexa Skill Store and makes it easier for others to find it too!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
