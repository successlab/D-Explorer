There is a heavier emphasis on high-end frequencies that can counteract incoming sounds and drown out the most insistent of external interruptions. My White Noise listeners may be my most passionately addicted \ud83d\ude04. People use this Sound Machine for all sorts of applications, but it's the gold standard when it comes to sound cancellation. It's wonderful for helping adults and babies alike to fall and stay asleep, for study, for meditation, for managing anxiety, or for any other activities where you want to block out the world and focus solely on the task at hand.\n\nEnjoy the Sound Machine used by over 1.3 million people every week, and tune out the world for once!\n\n[https://12hoursoundmachines.com](https://12hoursoundmachines.com/)\n\nFYI we also have Brown Noise and Pink Noise Sound Machines if you prefer those! Look for the skills with this same logo but that say Brown Noise or Pink Noise instead of White Noise. Or, just say \"Alexa, open Brown Noise Sound Machine\" or \"Alexa, open Pink Noise Sound Machine\".\n\n---\n\n***HOW TO USE***\n\nEnable this skill either by clicking the \"enable\" button above, or saying \"Alexa, open White Noise Sound Machine\".\n\nBy default, the White Noise Sound Machine will play until 1 hour time limit is reached (for the free version). To stop the Sound Machine before that say, \"Alexa, stop.\u201d To resume it again say, \"Alexa, resume.\"\n\n***SHOW YOUR SUPPORT:***\n\nIf this skill has been helpful for you, I'd be so grateful if you left a review! It actually helps a LOT to boost us on the Alexa Skill Store and makes it easier for others to find it too!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
