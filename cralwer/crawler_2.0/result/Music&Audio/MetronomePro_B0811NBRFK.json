We've updated the basic metronome with more interesting functions to enable you to practice music on your terms, without ever leaving your instrument.\n\nWe've focused on delivering an amazing experience, including understanding common tempo markings such as Andante or Allegro for you classical music fans, as well as creating \"custom sequences\" for heavy metal slayers. \n\nWhen you purchase custom sequences, you can create automatically have Metronome Pro increase the tempo to practice licks or passages at increasing speeds. Frequently, practicing involves playing a certain passage slowly, then increasing the tempo over time. Custom sequences does this for you without getting up from your chair.\n\nFor example, you can play:\n80 bpm for 30s\n90 bpm for 30s\n100 bpm for 30s\n120 bpm for 30s\n150 bpm for 30s\nAll in one sequence that you can name. \n\nSo go ahead, get your beat and practice on!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
