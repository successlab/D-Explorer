He's interviewed everyone from Presidents to world athletes and his knowledge of sports, pop culture, varied musical tastes, love of wine, world travel, you name it, Tony covers it with his unique outlook and sense of humor. With youthful energy, personable and approachable style, infectious laughter and overall love of life...it's no wonder Tony's amassed a very loyal following of listeners, affiliates and sponsors who laugh, live and learn right along with him!
