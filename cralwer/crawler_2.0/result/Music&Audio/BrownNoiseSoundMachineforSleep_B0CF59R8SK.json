Its soothing, calming, constant tones are wonderful for helping adults and babies alike to fall and stay asleep, for study, for meditation, for managing anxiety, or for any other activities where you want to block out the world and focus solely on the task at hand. It also has incredible sound masking properties for use in distracting and noisy environments!\n\nEnjoy the Sound Machine used by over 1.3 million people every week, and tune out the world for once!\n\n[https://12hoursoundmachines.com](https://12hoursoundmachines.com/)\n\nFYI we also have White Noise and Pink Noise Sound Machines if you prefer those! Look for the skills with this same logo but that say White Noise or Pink Noise instead of Brown Noise.
