The biggest hits of the 70's, 80's, 90's, along with hits of the 50's, 60's, & 2000's. We also include those lost hits that you haven't heard in forever; along with album cuts and deep cuts that perhaps you've never heard. \nIt's an eclectic mix where several decades & genres all co-exist harmoniously & have a non-stop party.\nBy the way, you're going to love our DJ who brings you some great music along with the cool trivia, facts, figures & stories behind the music. Give us a listen. You'll be glad you did.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
