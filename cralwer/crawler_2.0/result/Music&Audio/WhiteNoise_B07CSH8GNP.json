Fall asleep faster and wake up feeling refreshed. White Noise can play color noises, mechanical sounds, nature sounds, or rain sounds from 1 to 10 hours. As an example, say \"Alexa open White Noise and play Brown Noise for 4 hours.\" The audio will play brown noise continuously for 4 hours without interruption. For a list of all sounds, ask White Noise for the sound catalog. All sounds in the catalog will playback with absolutely no gaps in audio for the entire duration and the audio will slowly fade out before stopping. White Noise also remembers the last played sound and duration so you can quickly start it again tomorrow.\n\nAsk for Color Noise Playback\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to play [brown, pink, white, blue, purple, gray] noise for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] hours\"\n\nAsk for Rain Sounds\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to play [light, heavy, extreme, tent, lake] rain for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] hours\"\n\nAsk for Mechanical Sounds\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to play [airplane, box fan, air conditioner] for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] hours\"\n\nAsk for Nature Sounds\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to play [ocean waves, stream] for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] hours\"\n\nAsk for List of All Sounds\n\"Alexa ask White Noise for the sound catalog\"\n\nAsk to Preview Sound for 5 Seconds\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to preview Box Fan\"\n\nAsk for General Help\n\"Alexa ask White Noise for help\"\n\nGet Info on Each Color Noise\n\"Alexa ask White Noise for info on [brown, pink, white, blue, purple, gray] noise\"\n\nPlay Previous Sound and Duration\n\"Alexa ask White Noise to play\"\n\nPREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION\nStreaming uninterrupted audio from our servers for up to 10 hours at a time is costing us thousands per month. We had to make a tough decision to either call it quits or ask for help in funding this service. We are betting that our uninterrupted streaming service is so good that you'll be willing to help.
