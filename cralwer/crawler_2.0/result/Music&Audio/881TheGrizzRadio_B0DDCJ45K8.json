Our primary music formats are a mix of Classic Rock and Light Jazz, but students and volunteers add their own flavor with everything from Pop and Urban to Country and Latin. Live talk shows provide a unique Midwestern perspective on community college life and events. We top it off with specialty podcasts on sports, politics, popular culture and the arts. The station even works with our Theatre and Music programs to air original audio dramas: skit comedy, science fiction and the occasional dramatized documentary. It's classic college radio; we might not be the smoothest radio station in the world, but were very authentic!
