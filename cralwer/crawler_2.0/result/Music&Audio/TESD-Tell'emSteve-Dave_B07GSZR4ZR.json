This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: m. steve dave", "reviewnum": " 7", "des": "\"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave!\"\n\nA skill to play the podcast \"Tell 'em Steve-Dave\". If you're an ant, you know why you need this. If not, well it's a podcast featuring Brian 'Q' Quinn (Impractical Jokers), Bryan Johnson (Vulgar) and Walt Flanagan (Comic Book Men), chatting, laughing and busting each others chops. Trust me, it's one of the best podcasts out there.\n\nPlay any episode that is still in the feed, with classics like \"#012: Makin' Hay\", \"#264: The Bluejuice Comics 1 True 3 Invitational\", and \"#300: Git 'Em To The Chapel\". This skill will automatically update with new episodes, just say \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to play this weeks episode\".\n\nOther commands available:\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to play episode 300\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to play 'Makin' Hay'\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to play a random episode\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to play the latest episode\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to skip to fifteen minutes\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to fast forward one minute thirty seconds\"\n* \"Alexa, Tell 'em Steve-Dave to rewind one minute thirty seconds\"\n* \"Alexa, pause\"\n* \"Alexa, play\"\n* \"Alexa, next episode\"\n* \"Alexa, previous episode\"\n* \"Alexa, start over\"\n* \"Alexa, can you say that again?\" (this will tell you the episode title).\n\nVarious early episodes are missing from the feed, I hope to add them later. For example, episodes 1-11, 13-15, 18-24, 27-37 and 46-48 are all missing.\n\nThis skill is not official, and is not endorsed by any member of Tell 'em Steve-Dave.
