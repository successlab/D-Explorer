WHUM 98.5 FM Columbus, IN and 98.3 FM Seymour, IN are the most eclectic stations you will ever hear! WHUM is truly an 'island unto itself' in regards to music in these times. WHUM plays music that has international flavors to serve the musical needs of our growing, diverse, communities as they listen to music that is world renowned. Our philosophy is that people are not one-dimensional, so why should a radio station be? Rather than program different formats for the mornings, afternoons, or evenings, WHUM is proud to present many eras and genres of music all mixed together 24/7 except on Sunday mornings when we air good old hymns from 5 a.m.- 8 a.m. At 8 a.m. we break away from the hymns until 8:45 a.m. for a sermon sponsored by Lakeview Church of Christ. After the sermon, we return to hymns from 8:45 a.m.-10:00 a.m. It's the gospel that many Americans grew up with, but can no longer hear.\n\nSome ask what do we mean by eclectic? Well, you can listen to music that is world renowned such as Cajun followed by Reggae, New Age, Inca, Classic Country, Medieval, Irish, and Bluegrass. But, don't be surprised when Folk, Oldies, Adult Contemporary, Celtic, Adult Standards, Classic Rock, Gospel, Alternative, Adult Contemporary are in the mix. Have you got the idea yet? On WHUM, we always keep you guessing! Many listeners tell us they stay tuned in for the element of surprise since they expect the unexpected, and find it rather \"\"addictive\"\" since our variety just keeps them wanting more! Sure, a few conforming skeptics may wonder how we can go from Andrea Bocelli...to Richard Thompson...Sam Cook...Bennie Goodman...Beatles...B.B. King...Johnny Cash...Billy Holiday...The Rat Pack...The Drifters...Dolly...Cher...Louis Armstrong...Phish...The Clash...Blondie...Edith Piaf...Pink Floyd... Marilyn Monroe...Moody Blues...Glenn Miller...Rolling Stones...Pete Seeger...Peter, Paul, and Mary...Planxty...Lead Belly...Sissel...Josh Grobin...Enya...Ramones...Rusted Root just to mention a few out of our extensive play list. They'll ask us, \"\"How can a mix like this possibly flow together?\"\" It's easy because all the eras and genres are what our American Heritage music evolved from. Forget those skeptics! Just relax and listen to WHUM. It will not take long before you soon realize how these songs all evolved from each other. Tune in for more surprises than any other radio station has to offer you! Kick back and enjoy the musical adventure WHUM will take you on as you listen to the music you'll not find anywhere else. There is no place like HUM sweet HUM! \"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
