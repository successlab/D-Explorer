It\u2019s a throwback to the days of flannel shirts, baggy jeans, and neon colours. Our airwaves are filled with the decade\u2019s defining sounds, from the raw edge of Nirvana to the smooth R&B of Boyz II Men. We celebrate the era of mixtapes and MTV, bringing you the chart-toppers and the underground hits that still resonate today. Tune in for the anthems that made you dance, the ballads that made you sing, and the beats that never really left. This is your home for 90s nostalgia - where the classics play all day.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
