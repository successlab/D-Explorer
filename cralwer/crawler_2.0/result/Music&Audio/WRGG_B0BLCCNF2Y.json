Through WRGG, the foundation is able to further that mission. The 100-watt station may be heard throughout Greencastle and Antrim Township area and it broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 93.7 FM and on the web at www.wrgg.org. The station is community-oriented, relying heavily on news and information for and about the Greencastle and Antrim Township and surrounding area. Along with live broadcast of Greencastle-Antrim athletic and musical events, the station provides internships and many learning opportunities for the students of the Greencastle-Antrim School District. It also provides an outlet for community members to broadcast their areas of interest and hopefully become a showcase for local musicians. This community radio station has been made possible by a generous donation from the Shockey Family Foundation and other individuals. Receiving donations is an on-going process in order for the station to remain viable in the Greencastle-Antrim community.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
