In his early days, Arthur did construction work in various parts of the country. On one such trip he was working a construction site in Louisville, Kentucky. From his job site, he could look across the street into the windows of a radio station, in the evening after work, he would go to the station and sit in the audience, and watch the various live shows that were going out over the airwaves.\n\nHe wondered if a radio station might work in his hometown of Lenoir City. When he got home, he immediately applied to the FCC for a station license. In 1949, he was granted a license to operate WLIL on the clear channel frequency of 730 kHz. WLIL Radio went on the air on May 27, 1950, with daytime power of 1000 watts (1kW).", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
