Making use of any not-specialist press agency means to face extremely high costs, to be forced to filter the news the reader is looking for among the remaining ones related to any other fields by wasting time. It means to give up to descriptions and analyses of facts or news that are strongly based on technical, precise and reliable competencies.\n\nEverything is reported as neutral and transparent as possible, but in clear and comprehensible way so that the reader, may he be just the audience or a leader in that field, can draw his own conclusions or reflections about what happens in the worldwide aviation and defense, since AVIONEWS is political or industrial prejudice free.
