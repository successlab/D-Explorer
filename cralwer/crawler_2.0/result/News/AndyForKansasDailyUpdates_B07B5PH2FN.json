Andy is indeed a long shot in his run for Governor, as he does not live in Kansas. However under current Kansas law, that is not an obstacle. But the upshot is that Andy is raising money for a charity called Cure SMA. So add this to your flash briefing for a short daily update on what's going on in the campaign and/or a fun fact about Andy, Kansas or both.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
