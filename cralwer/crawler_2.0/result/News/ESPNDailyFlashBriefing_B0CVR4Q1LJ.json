This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "ESPN Daily is a podcast about much more than sports. Most daily sports shows focus on that day's news, game predictions, and player stats. This program has previews and recaps, of course. But many episodes discuss sports-adjacent stories, appealing to a different kind of listener.\n\nShow creator and original host Pablo Torre is Harvard-educated. He joined ESPN in 2012, writing for ESPN.com, and started ESPN Daily in 2020. In 2023, he left the show, and a rotating group of ESPN names took over hosting this podcast.\n\nSince the beginning, the ESPN Daily podcast has discussed topics rarely found in sports news. Torre talks about Creed III star Michael B. Jordan's directing debut. The host explains the events that led to the federal probe of the Washington Commanders. He even goes back in history with his retelling of the Orangeburg Massacre. That day, the police shot and killed three high school and college athletes during a protest.\n\nESPN Daily also explains the news one sees on SportsCenter. One episode goes through the reasons behind Lamar Jackson's contract woes. The show also explains the reasons behind Kevin Durant's trade. Torre talks about LeBron James' breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record. The NFL Super Wild Card Weekend gets its own episode. The show also discusses sports at the institutional level. One podcast episode reveals how MLB increased spending while claiming indigence.\n\nThe stories in ESPN Daily aren't all serious. The show talks about ChiefsAholic. The Kansas City fan allegedly funded his football mania by robbing banks. Another episode features acrobat Red Panda, who performs halftime shows during NBA games. The show also reveals the history behind the Bills Mafia. A popular episode explains the strangest World Darts Championship final ever.\n\nESPN Daily is a great listen for sports fans who like to know what's happening between games. The podcast consists of material that makes great dinner-party conversation. Sports enthusiasts may appreciate listening to it as part of their daily routine.\n\nAfter enabling this skill, say things like \"Alexa, what's my flash briefing\" or \"Alexa, what's in the news\" to hear your flash briefing.\n\nGo to Settings in your Alexa app and find \"Flash Briefing\" to move ESPN Daily to the top of your news brief!", "priv": ""}
