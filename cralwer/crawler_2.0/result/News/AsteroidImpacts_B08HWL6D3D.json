Level 0 includes small bodies like meteors which burn up in the atmosphere without causing any damage, and Level 10 means an impact is certain and the possible end of civilisation as we know it. You can expect that most of the time there won't be any potential impacts rated at Level 1 or above, so the skill falls back to the next Level 0 impact which will have tiny odds of impact, or will burn up. \n\nThe skill also tells you the next near-Earth object, when it's passing by and how close it gets.\n\nThe skill uses real data from NASA. The Sentry System supplies potentially hazardous asteroids and their Torino scale classification, and close approaches are from NASA's NEO Earth Close Approaches feed. A close approach is less than 0.05 au in the next 60 days, about 19.5 lunar distances. The time of the next closest approach is read out as UTC. This isn't strictly correct, as the time from NASA is estimated in TDB - dynamical time, which is a relativisitic time scale. Assuming that you're an Earth-dweller, the difference is about 2 milliseconds to terrestrial time.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
