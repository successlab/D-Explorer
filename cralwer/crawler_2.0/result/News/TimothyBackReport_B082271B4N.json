The big difference between 'The Timothy Bach Report' and your parent\u2019s news is that Tim doesn't just report breaking stories but focuses on providing a platform for you and the rest of the digital community to join the conversation.\n\nI like to have fun and serve some dad jokes with your daily news report, but in addition to news I\u2019ll also sit down with your favorite digital creators to get their thoughts on current events and bring a new perspective to the conversation. \n\nYou have three ways to join the community. First is by subscribing to my YouTube channel, The Timothy Bach Report, where you can watch news commentary, influencer interviews, live streams, and engage with other users in the live chats and comment section. Second is by following both my personal account and the channel page on instagram where you can catch breaking news updates, funny memes, and exclusive live hangouts with your favorite creators. And lastly, you can join my discord server where you can submit news tips, post text/photo/video responses that might be featured, and further engage with other viewers.\n\nMy goal is to create a community of informed viewers who respectfully share their unique views and perspectives with each other. Nothing is off limits, and inside this space neither hate nor cancel culture will be tolerated. \n\nWe\u2019re going to encourage each other to smile, be productive, and work to accomplish our unique goals. You can trust that the clickbait stops here cuz I\u2019m looking out for you.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
