The first is being knowledgeable about current events as they relate to the company you are interviewing with. The second is finding someone who works at the company (or used) to speak with - they can give you valuable insights on things like company culture, but can also help you better understand the interview process, or even become someone who champions your candidacy.\n\nInterviewLead is an interview preparation service, and this app gives you access to a sample of our tools. Specifically you can:\n\n1) Find out about current events regarding the company that you plan to interview with. You should use this information to:\n- ask intelligent questions, such as 'How do you think this will effect the company?'\n- state your own perspective on how you think this news event impacts the company\n\nIt helps to demonstrate to the interviewer that you did your homework, have a passion for research and analysis and studied the company!\n\n2) Find a person to connect with, based on specific criteria such as - your preferred location (if for example you want to speak with someone who works in New York vs. Boston), the job title you are interviewing for, and the school you attended", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
