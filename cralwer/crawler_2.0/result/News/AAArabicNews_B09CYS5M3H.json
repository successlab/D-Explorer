Being independent means that Akhbar Al Aan is impartial, with reporting that respects all socio-economic segments but is the voice of none. It means we act as a public good, finding and telling the stories that matter. Through our stories, we seek to shine the light of truth to increase the awareness and understanding people need about what is going on in their community, their nation, the region, and the world. Because hope and optimism flourish in that light, that is why we are dedicated to following the facts wherever they take us. We report from the frontlines, from conflict zones, from wherever the story takes us\u2014to find and tell stories that shape our world. With original fact-based content and the broader context, our stories are providing a more informative and enjoyable experience, one that brings viewers to the frontlines to feel and truly know the story. Because the world changes very quickly, and no one should be left behind. The story belongs to everyone.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe flash briefing content is in Arabic.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
