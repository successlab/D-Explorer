This skill is a flash briefing created from the public RSS feed available from Fox News. I created this flash briefing so Alexa will read it to me on a daily basis; eliminating another email from the inbox. The flash reports on Science and Technology news as reported by Fox News on their Geek Sheet emails. Jody Burnett and ButtonPushApps are not associated with Fox News so this is deemed as an (Unofficial) Alexa skill.
