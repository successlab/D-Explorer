Hello Universe aims to focus on the latter, offering a bit of respite to listeners in the form of short frequently updated news aggregations. Nothing's 'off limits', but the focus of the Hello Universe reports is on space, exploration, and continuing human development/advancement.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\n\nSay \"report\" for the latest Hello Universe report. Due to the nature of how the Alexa skill is set up the skill will automatically close after a report, so you'll need to re-open Hello Universe if you want to do other things.\n\nSay \"space fact\" for a random space factoid.\n\nSay \"about\" to know more about Hello Universe itself.\n\nOther invocations like \"Repeat\", \"Help\", \"Stop\" are also supported.\n\nYou can learn more about Hello Universe at https://hellouniverse.space and follow along at https://twitter.com/oh_hey_universe", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
