This is another one of my skills for disaster. I also engineered the FEMA Alexa skill for Region 3's flash briefing skill obtained from public RSS feeds relating to disaster preparation and recovery information. This skill can be included in your flash briefing settings in the Alexa app. You can ask Alexa to \"enable the Be Prepared skill\" then ask Alexa to \"Be Prepared to my flash briefings\" So enable it now and be prepared or get vital disaster recovery information even when your electricity has failed for your echo device. Access this with the app on your cell phone. Be prepared. Recover. #AmazonAlexaTechforGoodChallenge", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
