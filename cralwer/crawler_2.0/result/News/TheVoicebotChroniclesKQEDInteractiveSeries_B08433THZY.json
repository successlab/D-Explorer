And you might have questions.\n\nFor example, why doesn\u2019t the machine grasp what I\u2019m saying to it? Is it just machines that don\u2019t understand me? What about other people? \n\nA team of storytellers at KQED decided to explore this topic with the help of the voicebots themselves - the same voicebots you probably have sitting on your kitchen table. Episodes include both in-depth reporting as well as interactivity to bring you closer to the story itself.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
