You\u2019ll hear the candidates\u2019 latest debate positions, available soon after they\u2019re spoken. No need to sit through a debate and wait for your issue or candidate to come up. You can also hear the debate's funniest moments on demand.\n\nSay things like:\nWhat\u2019s the latest from Bernie?\nWhat does Senator Warren think about taxes?\nWhat's the latest on impeachment?\nTell me something funny.\n\nLike something you hear? Say \"Alexa, share that one!\". You'll be prompted to link your Twitter account via the Alexa app. Once you've linked your account, you'll be able to tweet out your favorite debate moments to your followers using your voice.\n\nAnd don't forget \u2013 you can always move on by saying, \"Alexa, skip\" in the middle of an answer to keep things moving.\n\nThe skill is flexible and moves wherever you'd like to go. Maybe you're listening to Biden speak on immigration, you can interrupt by saying \"Alexa, what does Klobuchar think about this?\" or \"Alexa, what does he think about health care?\" Go deep on an issue or broad on a candidate.\n\nDEBATE CRUNCHER is brought to you by your new friends at Sonic Sando.\nReach us at hello@sonicsando.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
