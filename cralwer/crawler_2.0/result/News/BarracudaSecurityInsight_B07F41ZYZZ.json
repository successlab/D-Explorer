Barracuda Security Insight is centered around the Cybersecurity Index (CSI), which is a measure of the threat level spanning attack vectors including Email, Web, Network and weaponized file types such as PDF and Microsoft Office documents.\n\nArmed with telemetry from billions of sensors deployed across the world, Barracuda Security Insight continually computes a Cybersecurity Index score based on the severity and volume of cyber attacks detected and blocked by Barracuda's security products and SaaS solutions. CSI scores between 80 and 110 are considered normal, whereas levels above that range are considered high or dangerous.\n\nTo get started, just say \"Alexa, open Barracuda Security Insight.\" Alexa will then give a brief summary of the current global threat level. You can ask for more information on specific threat vectors (Email, Web, Network), delve into individual file types, or learn about Barracuda's security offerings.\n\nIf you need help at any time, say \"Alexa, help.\" If you want to know the commands you can ask, say \"list commands.\"\n\nTo learn more about Barracuda Security Insight and stay up-to-date on critical threats and recommendations, visit Barracuda Security Insight at https://csi.barracuda.com.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
