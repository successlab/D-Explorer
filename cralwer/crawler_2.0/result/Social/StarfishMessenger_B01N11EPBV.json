You need to have an account on https://www.starfishmint.com and should be subscribed to Starfish services. You can use the skill to receive messages from your friends and family. To receive messages go on the website and fill up email id and name of the person you want to receive messages from. This will generate a link and send to your contact. Using that link your contact can send messages as text or as audio recordings. They can only send upto 90 seconds of audio recording. Each link is unique for the receiver and you can disable a link on the portal if you don't want to receive any more messages from your contact. Currently we do not notify users if they receive new messages from their contacts and this will be built in next phase based on feedback", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
