But sometimes knowing what to talk about can be difficult. Conversation Starter provides a new question for each day of the year to help serve as a starting point for you and your spouse to engage in meaningful conversation.\n\nDid you miss a day and would like to hear what you missed? You can always ask for a different day's question (today, yesterday, Thursday, May 12th, etc).\n\nThe questions for this app were provided by Lori at http://www.the-generous-wife.com for couple development and marriage ministry. Please see her website for more information.", "priv": ""}
