Each time someone checks for messages, they will hear the most recent one. If they say \"Tell me another, or give me more\", they will hear a random message from the list.\n\nThe messages should be short and sweet and filled with love and encouragement.\n\nIf you want to remove a message, say \"delete that message\"\nNote: Super Buddy will always remember the most recent person who heard their messages.\n\nCommands:\n\"Leave a message\"\n\"Leave a message for NAME\" ex: \"Leave a message for Olivia\"\n\"Tell NAME MESSAGE\" ex:: \"Tell Olivia, You're the Best!!\"\n\"NAME is here\" ex: \"Jimmy is here\"\n\"Check messages for NAME\" ex: \"Messages for Dave\"\n\"Looks like NAME has showed up\" ex: \"Looks like Dan has showed up\"\n\"Erase the last message\"\n\"Tell me another\"\n\"Help\"\n\nIf you like SuperBuddy, please let me know!
