Activity Chooser is an Amazon Alexa skill that takes input from the group, lets everyone voice their opinion, and picks the most popular choice.\n\nActivity Chooser is great for families trying to decide what game to play, friends who can\u2019t decide which movie to watch, and a group deliberating where to eat. Activity Chooser has endless possibilities.\n\nYou can pick between two session types, ranking and eliminator. Tell Alexa how many people you have. Each person is given a chance to make a suggestion. Then each person ranks the three suggestions they like the most. In eliminator mode each person selects the two suggestions they like the least. Afterwards, two suggestions will remain; each person selects the one they do not want. For both modes Alexa will weigh all the rankings and select the most popular suggestion.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
