The First thing to note, when opening the skill you\u2019ll be playing the latest episode, but if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for, you can always find something more specific. This skill allows you to play next or previous episode. In addition, you can ask the skill to play the newest or oldest episodes or if you want to get specific, play a specific episode by saying the episode number. Try some of these commands:\n\n**Next/Previous Episode**\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, next\u201d\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, previous\u201d\n\n**Select Latest Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask The New Stack Makers to play latest episode\u201d \n\n**Select First Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask The New Stack Makers to start from first episode\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
