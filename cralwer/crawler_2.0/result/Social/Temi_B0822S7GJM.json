While these actions can be performed using Temi\u2019s touch screen, Alexa delivers a full hands-free experience taking your robot to the next level.\nEnjoy!\n\nDisclaimer:\nCommunications between Alexa and Temi is relying on Alexa sending commands to Temi, which are subject to local environment and state Temi is currently in. \nAs such, an obstacle or an ongoing user interaction on the robot might block or delay the Alexa command from fulfilling. \nIf Temi is physically available, you\u2019ll get notified if the command has succeeded or failed.\n\n- Saving Locations.\n\nTemi comes with a default Home Base location (the docking station).\nAnd while being at the Home Base, new locations cannot be added.\n\nTo save a new location, make sure Temi moves away from the Home Base\n\nA local notification will be returned to the user near Temi, \nprompting whether the save was successful or not.\n\n- Planned Improvements\n\nFuture updates to the skill will allow other Alexa devices (Echo, Sonos etc)\nto be notified when long intents are triggered such as the \"go to\" or \"save location\", which \ntakes a variable amount of time to fulfill.\n\nFor instance, you will be able to ask Temi for the status\nand be notified if Temi has arrived to its destination location\nor was able to save a location or not.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
