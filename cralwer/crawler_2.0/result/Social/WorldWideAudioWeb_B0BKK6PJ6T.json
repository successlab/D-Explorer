This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: world wide audio web", "reviewnum": " 8", "des": "You can explore the interactive environment this skill provides and learn about all sorts of people, places and things. Using simple directional commands you can navigate from room to room. \nSections of the environment contain people's personal audio spaces. These contain information on themselves or their passions that they wish to share with others.\nOther sections contain spaces about different companies or institutions. Where they present themselves in an audio format.\nAs you explore you may discover others that are also exploring. Stop and have a chat! You can use the skill to converse with others in real time. You can also customize your avatar to give it any name or appearance.\nIf there is information you have, that you think others should know, you can apply to become an author. You can then create your own audio space within the web to share what you want. There are commands for creating new rooms, describing them, or new objects to decorate them or for people to pass around. If you are interested, but aren't sure, there is a sandbox in the park near the bus station, which is open for anyone to build in. Create something interesting, and then share it with others!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
