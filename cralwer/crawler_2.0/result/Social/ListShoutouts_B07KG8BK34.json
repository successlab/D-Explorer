If it's accepting both feedback get Alexa to learn it by providing feedback on the Alexa app or just input both names as lists manually. Then you can add whatever items to that list describing whatever you want Alexa to tell that person when invoking the skill. If this fails, try asking Alexa to create the list for you to establish how Alexa thinks your name is spelled. And if that is failing, go to your home and see what Alexa heard. Make sure you train Alexa to hear your names properly.\n\nLaunch the skill with the invocation \"shoutout\". And then Alexa will say a compliment in the list for a given person.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
