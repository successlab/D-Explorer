The O'Neill brothers and sisters settled in Toronto in the 1950's and built a large extended family in the Irish community. This skill lets you go into the family tree and discover aunts, uncles and relatives from any person in that tree. To position yourself in the family tree, you just say 'My birthday is Month day, year' and it will search the tree for the person with that birthday. Once it finds them, you can ask, 'Who are my grandparents/cousins/aunts...'.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
