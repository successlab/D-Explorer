And the app will grow as we discover the question people really want to know beyond life, the universe and everything!\n\nAt East Ave Church, everything we do is about Jesus\u2014and the only way to get to know Jesus is to understand what the Bible says about him, which also includes what he said about himself. So, our weekend messages tend to walk through books of the Bible, and delve into the history and how that applies to us today. Sometimes the passages are about marriage and sometimes they are about forgiveness, grace, charity or love \u2013 but it is always seen through the lens of Jesus.\n\nWe are a part of a group known as the Nazarenes. The Church of the Nazarene is a world-wide organization in well over 260 countries. We seek to bring the presence of God to local communities around the globe though things like clean water, medical clinics, agriculture instruction, soup kitchens and orphanages. Through these actions the message of God is lived out loud. Today you worship along side more than 1.5 million in hundreds of languages on six continents.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
