Where you discovered a level of brotherhood/sisterhood that could only be forged through playing video games, watching movies, television and discussing the finer things in life over an Orange Lavaburst Hi-C and Bagel Bites. We take the time out to talk about the current games we're playing, movies we've seen recently(new or old) and all the things in between. It\u2019s almost that time. The streetlights just came on and you had better leave soon to be Home Before Dark.\n\nHere are a few quick tips when navigating our skill. The First thing to note, when opening the skill you\u2019ll be playing the latest episode, but if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for, you can always find something more specific. This skill allows you to play next or previous episode. In addition, you can ask the skill to play the newest or oldest episodes or if you want to get specific, play a specific episode by saying the episode number. Try some of these commands:\n\n**Next/Previous Episode**\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, next\u201d\n\u2014 [While Episode Is Playing] = \u201cAlexa, previous\u201d\n\n**Select Latest Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask Home Before Dark to play latest episode\u201d \n\n**Select First Episode**\n\u2014 \u201cAlexa, ask Home Before Dark to start from first episode\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
