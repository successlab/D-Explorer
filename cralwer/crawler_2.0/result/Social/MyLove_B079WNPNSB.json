You create the list using the standard Alexa List voice commands or you can type them in using the Alexa app.\n\nMy Love uses the list called 'My Love', which it will create for you the first time you use the app if it doesn't already exist. You can also add items to the list using your voice by saying:\n\n\"Alexa, ask My Love to add you have beautiful eyes\"\n\nNote: While you can add items using your voice, you will find it faster and more accurate to add them using the Alexa app's List manager and adding/removing items from the list named 'My Love.'", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
