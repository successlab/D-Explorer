Friends and family get cut off and lose track of each other as homes are evacuated, cell service goes down, and life is disrupted. This skill helps reconnect people by providing a voice interface for the American Red Cross \"Safe and Well\" disaster registration system. The Red Cross system allows people affected by disaster to provide updates about their status and location. Friends and family can then check on their loved ones by searching for their name and phone number. Unfortunately, the Red Cross system doesn't allow you to make a list of people you're concerned about, and you have to check for updates one person at a time, re-entering their contact information each time.\n\nThis Alexa skill makes using the Safe and Well system easier and more user-friendly. It allows you to save information for multiple contacts and then have Alexa read you their updates all together.\n\nThe first time you use the skill, you will be asked for permission to access your Alexa lists. This will allow Alexa to create a new, special list named \"Safe and Well.\" Once that list is created, you can use the Alexa app on your mobile device or in a web browser to add contact information for the friends and family you'd like to keep track of.\n\nEach person's information should be added as one entry in the Safe and Well list. Add their first name, last name, and contact phone number separated by spaces, like this:\n\nFirstName LastName PhoneNumber\n\nIf you enter incorrect information or Alexa is unable to find information for a person in the Red Cross Safe and Well system, it will politely ask you to check their contact information.\n\nIf you'd like to test this skill and don't know anyone using the Safe and Well system, you can use this fictitious person:\n\nIvan Tecma 123-555-1234\n\nThis skill was developed for the #AmazonAlexaTechforGoodChallenge", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
