Then this skill is for you.\n\nMy Weekend will simply ask you if you have your kids this weekend, and based on the response will allow you to ask if you have your kids during future weekends.\n\nIt can be easy enough to know about the next couple of weekends, but the 'calendar math' gets difficult when you are trying to plan months out.\n\nAs a divorced father with a somewhat complicated custody arrangement, I built this help answer this question.\n\nIf Alexa has trouble with your kid's name, you can also say: \"Alexa, Ask My Weekend to add My Kid\" Or My Daughter, My Son, My Kids, Our Kids, The Girls, The Boys, etc.\n\nIf you need to start over just say, \"Alexa, Ask My Weekend to Start Over\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
