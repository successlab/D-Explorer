You can listen to any unread notes and also leave new ones.\n\nIf Alexa got your or your partner's name wrong (hey, it happens sometimes) just say \"Alexa, tell Love Notes my name is <name>\". She'll fix it and ask you to confirm your partner's name as well.\n\nSHARE THE LOVE\nLove Notes is part of Next Level Living's mission to help everyone live happier and more meaningful lives.
