You can also ask what shift falls on a particular day and which Battalion Chiefs are on duty. We've even loaded up this skill with some trivia from the show Emergency which aired on NBC in the 1970s and the popular movie Backdraft. And, if you have kids, you can ask FireTrex to play a siren. While FireTrex was designed to provide data to existing customers you can choose to activate the skill in experience mode to get a feel for its capabilities.
