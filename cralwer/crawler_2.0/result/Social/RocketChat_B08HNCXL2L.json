Every functionality that affects your account in any way comes with an intent confirmation. i.e. Before performing these operations the action will ask your confirmation and will execute the operation only on your approval.\n\n2. If an intent requires you to tell a channel name or user name, you don't have to worry about telling the exact name of the channel or user. You can roughly tell the name, and the action will automatically resolve it to one of the best matching names from your list of subscriptions. Again, you will get a confirmation after this resolution if that operation is exactly what you wanted to perform.\n\n\nSome useful intents and their uses are listed below.\n\n1. Do I have any unread messages: This will get your unread messages from your subscribed channels and direct messages.\n\n2. Get my unread mentions: This will get your unread mentions from your subscribed channels and direct messages.\n\n3.
