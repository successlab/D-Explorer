Not only does it bring a smile to their face, and a little bit of discovery to their morning, it also gave me an entirely new perspective and appreciation for them by forcing me to think of how wonderful they are first thing in the morning.\n\nOne of the hardest things after several years of doing this is to think of something new every morning. That's why I made Lovely Notes. First to help me, but also to help you!\n\nYou can get prompts in a number of different ways. If you want a complete wildcard, just say:\n\n\"Alexa, ask Lovely Notes for an idea.\"\n\nIf you want something more specific, you can ask for a prompt from one of four categories.\n\n\"Alexa, ask Lovely Notes for something to draw.\"\nWill give you a prompt for a fun and simple, post-it sized drawing.\n\n\"Alexa, ask Lovely Notes for something to write.\"\nWill give you a thought starter for a written note.\n\n\"Alexa, ask Lovely Notes for a compliment.\"\nWill give you a compliment to share with your pal.\n\n\"Alex, ask Lovely Notes for a quote.\"\nWill return an inspirational quote for you to share.\n\nIf at any point you need your prompt repeated, just say, \"Alexa, Ask Lovely Notes what was that?\"\n\nWant to learn more about why we built the app?
