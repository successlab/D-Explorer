By combining www.VoiceCapsule.com with the Alexa Skill Voice Capsule, users can then have virtual interactive conversations with the recordings. \n\nThe Voice Capsule concept has been in the making for over 20 years. Have you ever wanted to talk to someone and you know they are not available? The original concept was to have family and friends record their life stories. But, we needed to find an easy way to share those stories now and with future generations. With the Amazon Echo devices Alexa provides an avenue for those stories to be shared. \n\nBut as we began programming, we realized Voice Capsule can provide so much more. Every user can transform Voice Capsule into what would be most beneficial to them and whomever they share their recordings with.\n\nLife is better when you can have virtual interactive communications with recordings such as: \n1. Virtual Assistant makes life easier for those working from home or anyone needing to log activities or events and then search for them. Your potential client could ask the Alexa Skill Voice Capsule to show them one of your completed projects.\n2. Diary or journal. Ask Alexa Skill Voice Capsule to tell you what you did on a particular date. \n3. Story Journal. Ask Alexa Skill Voice Capsule to have Mom tell you about her favorite recipe.\n\nVoice Capsule is unique because it allows you to Virtually Interactively Communicate with yourself, friends and family beginning now and anytime in the future. Voice Capsule provides an audio search engine for your posted recordings. \n\nVoice Capsule is a Voice Time Machine because you can make recordings today and then you are able to talk to your younger self anytime in the future. How cool would it be if you left recordings today and future generations could have a virtual interactive conversation with you. \n\nTo get start with the Voice Capsule Skill \n1. Setup a www.VoiceCapsule.com account. \n2. Post audio or video recordings to www.VoiceCapsule.com and declare whether the recording will be private or shared with your selected contacts. \n3.
