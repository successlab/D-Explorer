You turn on the soundtrack when you leave your home. While you're gone, it plays police radio chatter. If someone comes into your home, the first thing they will think is that they have triggered an alarm and the police are en route. A very high percentage of home break-ins happen during the day when you\u2019re not home. As long as a burglar feels they are in control of the situation, they\u2019ll move in and out quickly and make your life very unstable. Assuming you\u2019re not home, a burglar fears two things - territorial dogs that bite and police. Your home is not worth it if they think they\u2019re going to get caught. Chaos Newport Beach will create fear for the intruder and they are more likely to leave immediately.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
