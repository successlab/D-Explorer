When visiting a new vacation rental and area, guests often have lots of questions - things like where the TV remote is located, what the best local restaurants are, and how to operate the AC, heating system, dishwasher, etc. Cheat-sheets get lost easily and often, and may guests end up during directly to their host for help. Home Service automates the process of getting answers to these questions, and ensures that your guests are in-the-know at all times. \n\nFor owners who manage multiple properties, it\u2019s hard to keep track of who\u2019s asking what, and keeping in touch with so many guests can take up quite a bit of time. Home Service can save you time and money by automating this question answering, and our first-of-its-kind authentication system allows you to scale as much as you\u2019d like.\n\nIn order to take full advantage of Home Service, please head over to https://homeservice.ai to set up an account and create your first property!
