This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: burglar deterrent\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 247", "des": "Burglar Deterrent is designed to help protect your home from unwanted visitors when you are out. It will give the illusion that your house is occupied using realistic audio to deter potential intruders. A would-be thief will be convinced someone is performing daily activities such as cleaning, talking, laughing, working in the home office and preparing food. This will complement your existing security arrangements, giving you an extra level of reassurance.\n\nChoose the environment that suits the location of your Alexa device:\n- Living room (Sitting Room, Lounge, Den, or any general room) \n- Kitchen (Dining Area)\n- Bathroom (Washroom, Shower)\n- Home Office (Study)\n- Barking dog (Guard Dog)\n- Games Room (Playroom) \n- Party\n- Baby crying (Nursery)\n- Garage (Workshop, Shed, D.I.Y.)\n\nHOW TO USE\nWhen you open Burglar Deterrent you will be prompted to select a sound environment. \nThe audio will continuously play until you say \"Alexa, stop\".\n\nWhen re-starting the skill you can now easily continue with the sound and settings you used last time. If you choose a new sound it's now easier to customise the activity level and background music. Your choices are remembered for future uses. Choose the combination of activity level and music that suits your needs best. \n\nActivity Level High - more action, less quiet gaps\nActivity Level Low - more realistic, more quiet gaps\nMusic On - background music playing \nMusic Off - just the sounds without music\n\n[NEW] SCHEDULING AND LINKING TO SMART SECURITY CAMERAS\nYou can use Burglar Deterrent on a schedule or when motion is detected from your smart security camera. \nFor full instructions visit:\nhttps://www.hero-software.co.uk/burglardeterrent\n\nREAL TIME MODE\nSubscribing to this premium feature gives you the option to start sounds with real time mode enabled. This will increase realism and respect neighbors by automatically adjusting sounds, activity level and volume based on the current time of day or night. For example with the Living Room sound during the day dogs will bark, vacuuming will take place and overnight the dogs will stop and more appropriate sounds such as watching TV can be heard. \n\nWHAT CAN I SAY?\nHere are some example phrases you can use as shortcuts:\n\"Alexa, ask Burglar Deterrent to protect the bathroom\"\n\"Alexa, tell Burglar Deterrent to simulate the home office\"\n\"Alexa, ask Burglar Deterrent to sound like the dining area\"\n\"Alexa, open Burglar Deterrent and protect the lounge\"\n\"Alexa, ask Burglar Deterrent for a barking dog\"\n\nFEEDBACK\nContact us: https://www.hero-software.co.uk", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
