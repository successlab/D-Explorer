We've all heard the phrase, location, location, location....Well, I prefer the term, community, community, community....\nSince 2007, I've been your local resource for all things Real Estate, Community and the Inland Empire.\nI've lived here all my life, raised my family here, and am a third generation business owner. Community is everything to me. What is it to you? Do you need family activities for your littles? Great school districts? Do you need to be close to public transportation? Or are you like me enjoying being an almost empty nester and needing to find new community events and volunteer opportunites? \nThe Inland Empire has the community for your needs, and together we can find the community that fits your needs. Enjoy my flash briefing, Facebook Page and Instagram at Inland Empire Homes with Jeannine, pinterest and Linked In for community events, real estate tips, updates on the market and ways to be involved. \nI'll see you out in the community!
