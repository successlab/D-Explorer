The threat of police en route to your home will make any intruder leave immediately. Chaos 911 creates the impression that an alarm has been triggered and the police have been notified. The Chaos 911 skill plays a soundtrack of radio chatter by police. Just open the skill when you leave your home. It plays constantly until you return. Anyone that enters your home will immediately hear the police scanner. Changing the \"status quo\" of a home intruder removes their power of control, creates chaos and confusion for the intruder and gives you one more chance at preventing theft in your home. Here's a video about the Chaos 911 Skill: https://youtu.be/IIc3Yp3g8qk", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
