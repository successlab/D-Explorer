Most homeowners don\u2019t have enough information early on, and end up unprepared for the realities of making significant changes to their homes \u2013 particularly for big-ticket remodels. The knowledge they do have often comes from reality-TV home makeover shows that gloss over the ingredients essential to success.\n\nRemodel Success breaks down remodeling into manageable bite-sized pieces so you can feel confident throughout the process, and have peace of mind with the end results.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
