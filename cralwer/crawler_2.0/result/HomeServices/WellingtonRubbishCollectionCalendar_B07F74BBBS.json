This is used to look up the correct schedule on the Wellington City Council website (https://wellington.govt.nz/services/environment-and-waste/rubbish-and-recycling). \n\nIf you have entered your address and can't get the skill to work please contact alexa@hindmar.sh and I'll take a look.\n\nThis skill is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Wellington City Council.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
