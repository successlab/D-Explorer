If you have not set up your account, search for an invite from your real estate agent or ask your agent to resend the invite. Once you link your Alexa account to your MoveEasy Concierge account, simply launch your automated concierge by using the phrase \u201dAlexa, launch MoveEasy\u201d. Then ask Alexa about any move or home service-related questions. Alexa will provide you the right details, connect you with top-rated home pros vetted and recommended by your agent, or have your amazing concierge reach out to you in case of any requests that Alexa cannot immediately assist you with. This skill will also give information about your utility providers and driver's license. This skill is supported on all Alexa echo series devices.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
