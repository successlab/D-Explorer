In 1965 they were ransomed out of Romania, and soon thereafter they established the global network of missions of which VOM is a part. The Wurmbrands based these missions on Hebrews 13:3, which instructs us to \u201cRemember the prisoners as if chained with them\u2014those who are mistreated\u2014since you yourselves are in the body also.\u201d \n\nThe Voice of the Martyrs continues this mission around the world today through the following purposes: \n\n1. To encourage and empower Christians to fulfill the Great Commission in areas of the world where they are persecuted for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. \n\n2. To provide practical relief and spiritual support to the families of Christian martyrs. \n\n3. To equip persecuted Christians to love and win to Christ those who are opposed to the gospel in their part of the world. \n\n4. To undertake projects of encouragement, helping believers rebuild their lives and Christian witness in countries where they have formerly suffered oppression. \n\n5. To promote the fellowship of all believers by informing the world of the faith and courage of persecuted Christians, thereby inspiring believers to a deeper level of commitment to Christ and involvement in His Great Commission. \n\nVOM Radio is a weekly, half-hour program where VOM\u2019s Todd Nettleton interviews courageous Christians who serve and live in countries and communities where the Gospel is violently opposed. These brave believers share their stories with joy and tears, conviction and compassion as they tell how the Gospel changes lives and how Christians faithfully and joyfully serve Christ, in spite of hardships and persecution. \n\nTo learn more about the ministry and sign up for VOM\u2019s free, award-winning monthly newsletter, visit www.persecution.com.\n\n\nOnce enabled, you can listen to the most recent episode by saying, \"Alexa, play The Voice of the Martyrs.\"\n\nTo pause or resume any episode, say \"Alexa, pause\" or \"Alexa, resume.\" To listen to previous episodes, say \"Alexa, play the previous episode.\" If you want to know the title of an episode while the episode is playing, say \"Alexa, ask The Voice of the Martyrs for the title of this episode.\" If you want to know the air date of an episode, say \"Alexa, ask The Voice of the Martyrs for the date of this episode.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
