This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: gratitude log", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "With all the stresses of daily life, it is easy to lose sight of the good things in our lives, the things for which we should be grateful. When we do reflect on these blessings, gratitude for what we do have can help us put things into perspective and move beyond the stressors.\n\nGratitude Log is a simple way for the user to focus on their blessings. Each user can log the blessings they value in their life in groups of three. They just say, \u201cAlexa log three blessings.\u201d This can be done repeatedly. After some blessings have been logged, then they can hear Alexa tell them three random blessings from their list whenever they say, \u201cAlexa, tell me my blessings.\u201d\n\nWe hope you try Gratitude Log and make using it a part of your day to help you get through the stresses in your life!\n\n(By the way, this Skill was written in early April 2020 while the developer was practicing social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
