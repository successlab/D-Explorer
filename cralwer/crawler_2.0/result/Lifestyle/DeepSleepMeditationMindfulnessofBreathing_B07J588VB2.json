Think of it like exercising a muscle that gets stronger over time. \n\nIn fact, \"Mindfulness of Breathing\", the practice of intentionally quieting or focusing the mind, creates physiological changes that are similar to those that happen in your body during the early phases of sleep.

Being able to get to that state on demand means that you\u2019ll have an easier time drifting off when you want to. \n\nNote: This skill does not provide medical advice, is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
