Each pose is introduced with both english and sanskrit names with guidance for arriving at the position, tips for posture and technique, and guidance for breathing. \n\nAlexa will select two poses at random to start your yoga routine. If you wish to practice an extra pose say, \"move to the next\". At any point, you can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit the skill.\n\nThis skill was created by Left Layne using a Skill Blueprint.
