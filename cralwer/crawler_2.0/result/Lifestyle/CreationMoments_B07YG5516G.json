After obtaining a degree in Chemistry and a teaching certificate from the University of Nottingham, he began an 18-year-long career as a high school science teacher. Outside of work, he was involved in his church, preaching, teaching and leading worship, as well as writing worship songs. In 2005, he joined Answers in Genesis and worked in their UK office for six years. He then moved to the United States in 2011 to work for Creation Today, in Pensacola, Florida. Today, he is Director of the Mount St. Helens Creation Center in Silverlake, Washington. From this base, he continues to travel around the United States, speaking on creation, Genesis and apologetics.
