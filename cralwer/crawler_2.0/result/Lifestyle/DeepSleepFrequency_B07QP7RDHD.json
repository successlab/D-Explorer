This third frequency is tuned to a specific frequency associated with different brain states, such as deep sleep. Binaural beats for deep sleep are an effective tool for people who have difficulty falling asleep or who have light and unsatisfactory sleep.\n\nThe vibration at 441 Hz used in binaural beats for deep sleep is a frequency that stimulates the limbic system of the brain, an area that is activated during REM sleep. By listening to this frequency, the brain is predisposed to enter a deep and restful sleep. In addition, binaural beats also help reduce brain activity and decrease heart rate, contributing to a sense of relaxation and calm.\n\nTo get the best results when using binaural beats for deep sleep, it is recommended to lie down in a comfortable place, close your eyes, and breathe deeply, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. The frequency of deep sleep will lead you to a state of drowsiness and relaxation of the body, allowing you to fall asleep quickly. The use of binaural beats is an effective technique for improving sleep quality and achieving deep, restful sleep.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
