This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: chat g. p. t.", "reviewnum": " 5", "des": "This is an Alexa skill that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses from the ChatGPT model.\nYou can send two requests per day for free. I always use the latest model \u2013 currently 4o or 4o-mini.\n\nBeyond that, you have two options:\n 1. You can purchase unlimited access by saying \u201cbuy unlimited access\u201d or \u201cI want to buy unlimited access\u201d once you\u2019ve started the app (this works with \u201cAlexa, start Chat GPT\u201d \u2013 GPT pronounced in English).\n 2. You can use your own API key \u2013 visit https://alexa.onlypxl.com/ for this.\nThere, you\u2019ll need your user ID. To get it, simply ask \u201cWhat is my user ID?\u201d when the skill is running.\nOn the website, you can also set up a custom prompt \u2013 for example, \u201cAlways end responses with a chuck norris joke.\u201d\n\nPlease understand that, temporarily, the API key option also requires a subscription. With the small fee, you support the server operation costs, such as those for Hetzner, AWS, and OpenAI. If these costs can be covered by regular \u201cunlimited access\u201d subscriptions, I will reduce or eliminate the prices \u2013 so check back occasionally.\n\nThe subscription for accessing the skill with your own API key is called \u201crelease\". You can purchase it by saying \u201cBuy the release.\u201d\n\nFor any issues, please email onlypxlreply@gmail.com, including your user ID.\n\nThis skill is brand new, so there may be bugs. But maybe we can create an awesome skill together!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
