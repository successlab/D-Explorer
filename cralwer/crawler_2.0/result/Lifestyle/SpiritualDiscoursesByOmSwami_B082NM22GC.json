The man or the guru is portrayed as nothing short of a superman. Well, I\u2019m not one of them. I have no desire to glorify myself in a third-person narrative.\nI\u2019m a simple sadhu in a complex world. I don\u2019t conform to the traditional code of being a sadhu or monk though. I remain non-traditional, independent and unchained. So, don\u2019t be taken in by my robes or set your expectations based on what I wear. I dress in them because I like it that way.\nJust like some devote their life to music or painting, I devoted it to meditation and tantra. My only introduction are my writings. I write books and I write on my blog once in two weeks. You are welcome to pick and choose what you like and leave aside what you don\u2019t. Don\u2019t follow me or anyone else. Like a honeybee takes the nectar from a flower and goes back to its hive, take knowledge or wisdom from any source but go back to your inner voice. Discover your own truth, walk your own path. That alone will set you free.\nMy achievement is not what I have, My introduction is not what I do, It is but who I am. A nobody. I sing I laugh I dance I clap, A speck of dust in the infinite creation, A vast ocean in the tiny dew drop, A Himalayan stream, The still mountain, I am That. So are you. Compassion is my religion and love, my only philosophy\".\n\nPlease note that some part of audio played is in Hindi language.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
