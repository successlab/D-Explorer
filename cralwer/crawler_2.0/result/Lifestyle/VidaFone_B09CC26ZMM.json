Skill sends a message from the customer to a platform where an attendant will receive the message. The attendant can respond with text that will be read as notification on the customer's Alexa device. In addition, Skill automatically sends SMS text messages, e-mails and others through the platform to registered people. Skill can be used by people who want to send a message to an attendant who can assist in communicating this message to someone designated. This Skill only works for those who have an active account on the service platform Contactto.care, from Tecnosenior.\n\nThe telephone number configured in this Skill is used only for identification on the service platform. Along with the account number, the system recognizes the active account on the platform and generates a message to the attendant who, in turn, will communicate through a notification to Alexa.
