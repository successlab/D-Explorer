This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: bible on narcissism", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "The Bible does not specifically mention Narcissistic Personality Disorder by name. It does, however, discuss many traits of narcissism. Many narcissists claiming to be \u201cChristians\u201d, \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201creligious\u201d refuse to acknowledge these verses, and only quote ones that benefit them, such as ones regarding forgiveness or honoring parents. That does not change the fact the Bible has plenty to say about narcissism!\nThis skill shares examples of what the Bible has to say about Narcissistic Personality Disorder, specifically the Amplified translation. Remember, 2 Timothy 3:16 says, \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed [given by divine inspiration] and is profitable for instruction, for conviction [of sin], for correction [of error and restoration to obedience], for training in righteousness [learning to live in conformity to God\u2019s will, both publicly and privately\u2014behaving honorably with personal integrity and moral courage];\u201d, so please consider these verses, especially if you have received abuse under the guise of Christianity.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
