At Bezateli, we don't just want to sell products but establish a deep connection with the customers and pass on our ideology of trying to preserve environment by the smallest action possible. People always underestimate the potential of the smallest choices that we make in our day-to-day life but let me get to this straight, \"The simplest choices that you choose ain't simple, it's actually huge\". So every wise choice you make could leave a huge pact on the environment. And one simple thing that you can do is to choose sustainable and eco-friendly brands over the other ones.\nAnd why shouldn't you do it ?\nYou are getting better quality at the the cheaper prices and you are contributing to save the environment.\nAt Bezateli we don't want to promote regular brand-consumer relationship but instead build a community of serious and like minded people to get up and take actions to build a sustainable society.Instead of looking at the society as a market and the individual as a consumer, a sustainable society would emphasize its goals on human well-being and the health of its environmental assets.\nSo summing up Bezateli in two sentences:\nBezateli is a change-maker and a status-quo shaker, bringing to present a future that celebrates both a healthy earth and a strong economy. We are creating a novel sustainable community with you, us & our sustainable brand partners.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
