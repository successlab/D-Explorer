It contains 50+ teachings from Bhagavad Gita in the form of short Quote.\n\nWhat is Bhagavad Gita? \n\nThe Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna. At the start of the Dharma Yudhha (righteous war) between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and despair about the violence and death the war will cause. He wonders if he should renounce and seeks Krishna's counsel, whose answers and discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna counsels Arjuna to \"fulfil his Kshatriya (warrior) duty to uphold the Dharma\" through \"selfless action\". The Krishna\u2013Arjuna dialogue covers a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war Arjuna faces.\n\n\nImportance Of Bhagavad Gita :\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita presents a synthesis of Hindu ideas about dharma, theistic bhakti, and the yogic ideals of moksha", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
