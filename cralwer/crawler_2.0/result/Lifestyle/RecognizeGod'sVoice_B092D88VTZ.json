What did he say? How did you know it was God? \n\nHow can you discern it is God speaking rather than your own desires or even the Devil? \n\n\u25cf James 3:14\u201315: But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. Such \u201cwisdom\u201d does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.\n\nVerse 14, indicate two barriers for knowing God\u2019s will. \nVerse 17 are confirmation of God\u2019s will.\n\nWe make bad decisions when we compare (\u201cbitter envy\u201d) ourselves to others rather than God. We make bad decisions when we are selfish rather than sacrificial. How have you seen this principle in practice in your own life or those you love?\n\n\u25cf James 3:17: But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.\nHow could you use James 3:14-17 as a test for assessing a \u201cword\nfrom the Lord\u201d?\nAnd this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ\u2014to the glory and praise of God.
