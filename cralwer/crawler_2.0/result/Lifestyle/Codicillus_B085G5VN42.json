The note should not be longer than 6 seconds. If you can say the note at a conversational pace with one breath, the length is probably good. If you need to take a breath, consider reducing the length. For a note that includes successive ideas, such as steps in a task, record each idea separately. While the entire note may require more than one breath, make sure you only take breaths between and not during ideas.\n\nThe spoken note will be saved in the page 'Notes' in the section 'Alexa Notes' of the OneNote - Notebook 'Codicillus Notes'\nwhich is linked with the Microsoft user account.
