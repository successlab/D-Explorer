This is the precise vision of Bridging the Gap \u2013 to broadcast God\u2019s Word and to watch it work in the lives of people!\n\nBridging the Gap airs the Bible teaching of Pastor Lloyd Pulley, senior pastor of Calvary Chapel Old Bridge. The Bridging the Gap radio program began in 1994 with a shortwave broadcast airing Pastor Lloyd\u2019s messages in Europe. Shortly after, the ministry began airing Pastor Lloyd\u2019s teaching in the New York area. \n\nSince then, Bridging the Gap has expanded, airing Pastor Lloyd\u2019s messages on stations throughout the United States, on the Calvary Old Bridge app, and via podcasts. In every aspect, the radio ministry has seen God fulfill His promise in Isaiah 55:11:\n\nSo shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth;\nIt shall not return to Me void, \nBut it shall accomplish what I please, \nAnd it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.\n\nOnce enabled, you can listen to the most recent episode by saying, \"Alexa, play Bridging the Gap.\"\n\nTo pause or resume any episode, say \"Alexa, pause\" or \"Alexa, resume.\" To listen to previous episodes, say \"Alexa, play the previous episode.\" If you want to know the title of an episode while the episode is playing, say \"Alexa, ask Bridging the Gap for the title of this episode.\" If you want to know the air date of an episode, say \"Alexa, ask Bridging the Gap for the date of this episode.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
