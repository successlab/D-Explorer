They feel bright and full of hope; they dream big. Some of the common reasons why people start new businesses are that they are ready to be their own bosses, want to pursue their passion, or they see the opportunity they can't miss. Yet, plenty of small business statistics show that by the end of four years, more than half of them will be gone. Roughly about 80 percent of new businesses will make it to the second year. Commonly stated reasons, why entrepreneurs fail is to do with no market need for products or services or running out of cash or not having the right team.
