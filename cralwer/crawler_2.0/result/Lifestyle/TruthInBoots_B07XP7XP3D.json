Through the podcast, women learn that the Word of God has answers to their questions about God, answers to encourage them through hard trials and struggles, and answers for anyone who questions their faith. The truth of God's word is not fragile, impractical, and only used on special occasions like a pair of stiletto heels. God's word, like a pair of sturdy boots, is meant to be put to work daily and is designed to protect you and help you through the mud, streams, and rocks of life.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
