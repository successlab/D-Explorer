Just say \"show me\" followed by the name of the animal. For example, \"show me a cat\" will display a cat on the screen.\n\nFor some animals, the sound produced by the animal can also be heard. You can for example listen to the meowing of a cat or the roar of a lion if you ask for these animals.\n\nIt is possible to switch to \"random\" mode, that is to say that the skill will display the image of an animal present in its library of images, chosen randomly. Just say \"random\".\n\nMore than 230 animals are in the data library.\n\nIn the case of a dog, you can ask to see a dog, but you can also ask for a particular breed (a Dalmatian, a Pekingese or a chow chow for example). Not all breeds are necessarily present.\n\nIn the case of birds, a large list of birds is present in the library, including a lot of raptors.\n\nYou can ask to see relatively well-known animals like the horse, the cow, the lion, etc. An attempt has been made to be as precise as possible and in some cases to offer animals linked to the request. When you ask for a lizard, an image of a lizard will appear. The skill will indicate that the chameleon, gecko or iguana are also present in the database.\n\nYou will also find much lesser known animals like the lycaon, the okapi, the ocelot, the bearded vulture or the cassowary.\n\n\nThere is no image of fish, molluscs, insects, invertebrates in general, with a few exceptions such as the shark or the snail.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
