This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: symptom helper", "reviewnum": " 6", "des": "The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis. Call your doctor to receive medical advice. If you think you may have a medical emergency, please dial your local emergency response phone number. Symptom Helper merely records the information the user tells it to form concise symptom descriptions.\n\nThe time that a clinician and you, the patient, have to talk during an office visit is decreasing. Symptom Helper is a Skill to help increase the efficiency of one aspect of that interaction \u2013 the recounting of your symptoms to your care provider. Until now, the clinician had to gather information from you during the office visit. With Alexa, many of those questions could be asked in your home prior to the visit, and a short, relevant symptom statement could be generated that could then be shared with your clinician via a custom Symptom Helper List on your Alexa App during your office visit. \n\nHere is how you would use it:\n1. After enabling Symptom Helper, you register in the database log with a first name, by saying \u201cRegister me.\u201d \n2. You can then enter symptoms into the skill, by saying \u201cLet me log a symptom.\u201d You will then be given the choice of answering approximately 12 questions at once or answering about half of them initially (Part 1). Should you choose to enter just the first 6 questions, you will be able to complete the rest when you are ready. With either choice you will get a concise symptom summary. Why so many questions? Well typically, there are some key questions that the clinician will want to know about the symptom, including onset, frequency of occurrence, things that improve it & things that worsen it, among others. \n3. To answer the remaining questions for a partially entered symptom just say, \u201cTell me the symptoms I should complete.\u201d Alexa will then give you a list of those symptoms from which you choose the symptom you wish to complete.\n4. To retrieve a listing of your symptoms formatted concisely from the symptom database, you can say, \u201cTell me my symptoms,\u201d \n5. & 6. An extremely useful feature of Symptom Helper is the ability to create custom Symptom Helper Lists on your Alexa App on your smartphone. While you can add medical specialty lists one by one, by saying, \u201cCreate a Symptom Helper List for me,\u201d to help you get started, you can get 7 commonly used lists created just be saying, \u201cCreate my initial group of specialty lists.\u201d You\u2019ll then get Symptom Helper lists for Primary Care, Cardiology, Dermatology, Endocrinology, Orthopedics \u2013 Rheumatology, Pulmonary, and All Combined. (You will need to grant permissions to read and write to lists to use several of these functionalities.)\n7. If you have already created a Symptom Helper list on your Alexa App, you can add any of these spoken Symptoms to that list. Just say, \u201cLet me add a symptom to one of my lists.\u201d\n8. To change the status of a symptom from Active to Resolved or vice versa say, \u201cLet me change the status of one of my symptoms.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, even after answering all the questions, your clinician will probably have a few more to ask, but by using Symptom Helper you can give that conversation a great start.\n\nHere are a few more features of Symptom Helper:\n9. To delete an individual symptom, just say, \u201cLet me delete a symptom,\u201d and you will be led through the process to delete the symptom from the log.\n10. To start the process to delete a logged patient, you can say, \u201cLet me delete a patient.\u201d This will also delete any associated symptoms in the database as well as the patient. It will not delete any symptoms already on the patient\u2019s Symptom Helper List on the Alexa App.\n11. To get some coaching on how to describe your symptom in preparation for your doctor visit, you can say, \u201cCoach me on describing my symptoms.\u201d\n12.
