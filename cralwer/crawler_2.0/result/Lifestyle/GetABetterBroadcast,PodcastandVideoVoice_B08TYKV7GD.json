There\u2019s scant advice on improving our voice, let alone how to look after it. We learn how to speak simply by mimicking! Unless we take expensive lessons, rarely are we taught how to support our voices, how to sit and breathe properly, or how to read aloud convincingly.\n\nIn fact, sometimes we actually un-learn the natural techniques that we were born with!\n\nAnd yet communication with the human voice is more prolific than at any other time in our evolution: thousands of TV and radio stations, millions of podcast episodes, more than a billion YouTube videos\u2026 plus millions more audio books, commercial voiceovers, e-learning commentaries and business-related videocalls.\n\nThis is the guide to help you become a stronger voice communicator on all of those channels so you can better compete with professional actors, or presenters on the likes of the BBC, ABC, or Gimlet. \n\nIt focusses specifically on your vocal image for audio and video channels (not stage presentations, business meetings, lectures or sermons) and with two main aims:\n\u00b7 To get you a better voice for audio and video channels.\n\u00b7 To show you how to read out loud convincingly and conversationally\n\nYou\u2019ve invested in your look of choice, now invest in your voice.\n\nPresented by Peter Stewart\n\nPeter has been around voice and audio all his working life and has trained hundreds of broadcasters in all styles of radio from pop music stations such as Capital FM and BBC Radio 1 to Heart FM, the classical music station BBC Radio 3 and regional BBC stations. He\u2019s trained news presenters on regional TV, the BBC News Channel and on flagship programmes such as the BBC\u2019s Panorama. Other trainees have been music presenters, breakfast show hosts, travel news presenters and voice-over artists.\n\nAfter leaving university with a degree in Communications, Peter went on to work at a number of radio stations as a news reader/journalist and then branching out into other presentation roles such as a music DJ, talk-show and phone-in host. His styles varied from the \u201cfresh fun and exciting\u201d news presentation at a commercial station, to more formal reads on the BBC. For several years he was heard on nationwide UK stations such as talkSPORT and Virgin Radio.\n\nDuring this period, Peter was the winner of a prestigious New York Radio Award for his radio news presentations. He was the off-screen voice of the daily video news bulletins on Virgin Atlantic flights for several years, was co-host of the Telewest Cable show \u201cGet A New Life\u201d for three seasons, and was the voice for a series of radio commercials for a chain of electrical superstores. \n\nPeter has studied on the \u201cVoice for Performance\u201d course with London\u2019s prestigious Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and is also \u201cVocal Health First Aid\u201d certified.\n\nHe has written a number of books on audio and video presentation and production (\u201cEssential Radio Journalism\u201d, \u201cJournoLists\u201d, two editions of \u201cEssential Radio Skills\u201d and three editions of \u201cBroadcast Journalism\u201d) and has written on voice and presentation skills in the BBC\u2019s in-house newspaper \u201cAriel\u201d.\n\nIn his three years in the BBC\u2019s training unit, he became the Corporation\u2019s only in-house voice-trainer, coaching hundreds of broadcasters, many of them \u2018household names\u2019 from regional radio and TV, from all the national radio networks and those at the prestigious BBC News Channel.\n\nPeter has presented hundreds of radio shows, has read several thousand news bulletins, and hosted nearly 2,000 podcast episodes, and is a vocal image consultant advising in all aspects of voice and speech training for presenters on radio and TV, podcasts and YouTube , voiceovers and videocalls.\n\nHis voice-style is middle aged, male, RP, and friendly-authoritative.\n\nIf you would like Peter to work with you on your voice, then get in touch.
