What if we could give our family a mindset shift? \nSomething that was light and happy and had our hearts feeling loved and supported. \n\nThat\u2019s what Create Courage is. \n\nIt\u2019s an Alexa skill that you can subscribe too in order to assist you and your family with affirmations, mindset shifts, as well as \nopen the door to conversations that curate ways of positive thinking. \n\nWhat we start now becomes a habit. So let\u2019s make positive thinking, believing in you and themselves, feeling happy, and improving well being the foundation and habit they hold tight to. \n\nWe hope you enjoy this as much as we do. \n\nFrom our family to yours. \n\nListen to weekly affirmations and journal prompts. You can just say \"Alexa, what's my flash briefing\", or \"Alexa, Open Create Courage\". You can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit anytime.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
