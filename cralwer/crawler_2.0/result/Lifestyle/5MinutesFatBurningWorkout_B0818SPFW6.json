It engages all the abdominal muscles, reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and strengthens the muscles on the side of the abdomen, which are usually very difficult to get. The bicycle crunches exercise works out your upper, middle and lowers abs all at the same time. Crisscross is quite a challenging exercise, as it trains your entire core. It strengthens your abs and lower back. Reverse crunches mostly train your lower abs, and hip and thigh muscles, including iliopsoas, tensor fasciae latae, quadriceps and adductors. \n\nDon't forget to breathe correctly and keep your back straight while doing the exercises.
