First, register, by saying, \"Register me.\" Then you can do the following: \n2. Enter a breathing self-evaluation into the database, by saying, \"Let me do a breathing self-evaluation.\" \n3. Hear your breathing self-evaluations from your database log, by saying, \"Tell me my breathing self-evaluations.\" \n4. Hear your first and last breathing self-evaluations, by saying, \"Give me my first and last Breath Tracker self-evaluations.\" \n5. Hear your last two breathing self-evaluations, by saying, \"Give me my last two Breath Tracker self-evaluations.\" \n6. Create a custom Breath Tracker List on your Alexa App, by saying, \"Create a Breath Tracker List for me.\" \n7. Add one of your breathing self-evaluations to your custom Breath Tracker list by saying, \"Let me add one of my evaluations to my Breath Tracker list.\" In the clinician's office, you can then read or show your list on your Alexa App to them. Or, you can press the blue Alexa icon on your Alexa App and say, \"Read Bob's Breath Tracker Self-Evaluations List,\" using your name instead of Bob. \n8. You can set a reminder to do weekly breathing self-evaluations with Breath Tracker by saying, \"Set a reminder for me to use Breath Tracker.\" \n9. You can say, \u201cHelp\" to hear this information at any time. \n10. Finally, you can say, \"Repeat\" to hear most of the information that was spoken repeated. \nAgain, please bear in mind that this tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
