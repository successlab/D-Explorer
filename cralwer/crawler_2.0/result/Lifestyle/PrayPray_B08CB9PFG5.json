The skill so good, you say it twice!\n\nPrayPray is the ultimate Alexa skill that allows Muslims from around the world to take advantage of the Alexa technology in providing a powerful platform for families to get Salaat time reminders, Islamic recitations, relevant calendar events, and even local Masjid specific information.\n\nThe goal is to be the best Voice-Assisted Information Hub for Muslims everywhere. With PrayPray, you can do some amazing things such as setup automated reminders for prayers such as;\n\n\u201cAlexa, ask Pray Pray to setup my daily reminders for Fajr prayers\"\n\nOR\n\n\u201cAlexa, ask Pray Pray to setup ALL my daily reminders for prayers\u201d\n\nThat's it. You say it once, and Pray Pray will setup all of your family's prayer reminders. Parents can do this even for specific Alexa-supported devices!\n\nPray Pray can even play various Azaans and Surahs on command, or even setup fixed-time reminders for specific events;\n\n\u201cAlexa, ask PrayPray to remind me 30 minutes before Maghrib Salaat starts\u201d.\n\nADVANCED USERS: Version 2.0 introduces a sub-skill that allows you to setup a routine for automated Maghrib Azaan to play. Visit https://praypray.com for more setup information.\n\nThe real magic comes in the local content that you can receive from your local participating* Masjid.

Believe us, this is the #1 item on our list to enable, and with version 2.0, we have fixed this for Maghrib Prayers. Please visit https://praypray.com for more details on how to configure this.\n\nUntil we get the Alexa Development team to enable more features to allow us to add this feature for the other 4 Salaat times, please simply use any of the various commands available at your disposal.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen Alexa says: \"This is a Reminder from PrayPray. It's time for Asr Salaat.\"\n\nYou can respond with: \"Alexa, ask PrayPray to play the Azaan.\"\n\nWe realize this is just a workaround for the time being.
