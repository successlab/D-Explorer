For every product sold, we partnered with Feeding America to donate a meal to someone in need. That is a wellness choice you can feel good about.\n\nOur commitment to the community also shaped the ingredients we chose to use and exclude in our products. We designed our supplements with concentrated doses of the highest quality, all-natural micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to offer quick and safe results to optimize your mind and body to its fullest potential. If you are a meat-eater, the promise of vegan supplements might not seem like a draw, but it would be if you knew how other companies derived their protein sources\u2026 Going vegan is not the easy route in regards to nutrition, but it is incredibly effective and responsible. Plus, we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nWe at Wellthy know everyone has different health and beauty goals and always kept that at the forefront of our minds while creating our line. We worked closely with our scientists and pharmacists to ensure our products are not only effective but safe. Designed and manufactured in an FDA-registered, Good Manufacturing Practices Certified facility, you can trust these products do what we say they do.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
