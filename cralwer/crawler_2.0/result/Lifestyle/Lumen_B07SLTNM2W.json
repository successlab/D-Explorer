We will do so following a stepwise process. Let\u2019s begin by thinking about a problem you\u2019d like to work on today. A problem is defined as a situation in which an immediate and easily recognizable solution is not apparent. We want to focus on the \u201chere and now\u201d so this problem should be something that is currently affecting you and some obstacles stand in your way of trying to solve it. Also, it should be something that you have at least some control over how it can get solved. Remember to be as clear and specific as possible when describing the problem. I\u2019ll give you a second to think about it, and whenever you are ready, just let me know: what is a problem that is on your mind?", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
