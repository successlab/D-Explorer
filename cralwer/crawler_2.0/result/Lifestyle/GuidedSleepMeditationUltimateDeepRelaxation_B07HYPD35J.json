The mind-calming practice can be done at bedtime or any time during the day to help fight fatigue & insomnia.\n\n\"Guided Sleep Meditation\" helps you learn how to let go of the stresses of the day. Think of it like exercising a muscle that gets stronger over time. This allows you to tap into that same ready relaxation state when it\u2019s time to say goodnight.\n\nIn fact, \"Guided Sleep Meditation\", the practice of intentionally quieting or focusing the mind, creates physiological changes that are similar to those that happen in your body during the early phases of sleep. Your pulse slows, blood pressure drops, and stress hormones decrease. Being able to get to that state on demand means that you\u2019ll have an easier time drifting off when you want to. Bedtime Meditation helps you overcome insomnia, reduce stress and improve sleep quality. Fall asleep more easily.\n\nNote: Guided meditation will end with \"Good night\" greeting and you won't have to say anything to end the skill. That way your state of relaxation is not disturbed.\nDisclaimer: The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
