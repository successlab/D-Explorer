This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: my sprinklers", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "With Irrigreen, you can start your sprinklers, stop your sprinklers, and inquire about the status of your system all with voice commands.\n\nIn order to use this Alexa skill, you will need a working Irrigreen sprinkler system installed along with an active Irrigreen account. Your account will be used to link with this skill, so please have your account credentials ready. You will not be able to use this skill without an Irrigreen account and will need to launch the skill from the Irrigreen 2 IOS app.\n\nFirst, make sure that you have opened this skill from within the IOS app and complete account linking for the skill. After account linking, your controller number should automatically be added to your Alexa account. If you have multiple controllers associated with your account, you will need to specify the controller you would like to add. This can be done by saying, \"Alexa, tell my sprinklers to add controller _____\" with your controller number at the end. You will only be able to add controllers that are linked to your Irrigreen account. Please note that currently only one controller can be added to Alexa at a time, so adding a controller when one is already stored will overwrite the previously added controller.\n\nOnce your controller is configured, you will be able to interact with it. Open the Alexa skill by saying, \"Alexa, open my sprinklers\". You are able to perform a quick run of a zone or of your entire system. To do a quick run of the whole system, say, \"start watering\". To do a quick run of a certain zone, say, \"run zone ___\" followed by the zone number, or say, \"run ___\" followed by the name you have given the zone. Then, at any time, you can tell your skill to \"stop watering\" and all current watering will cease.\n\nYou can also ask if your system is watering by asking, \u201care my sprinklers watering?\u201d and Alexa will tell you if your system is currently watering and in what zone.\n\nTo end your session with Alexa, you can say \u201cthat\u2019s all\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d, or let the Alexa session timeout on its own.\n\nRequires activation in the IrriGreen 2 iOS app", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
