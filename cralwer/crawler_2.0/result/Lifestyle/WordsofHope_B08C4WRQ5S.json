You can pause and play by saying \"Alexa, pause\" and \"Alexa, resume.\" Just say \"Alexa, stop\" when you're done for the day. When listening to podcasts you can say \"Alexa, shuffle\" to shuffle the playing order, or \"Alexa, loop\" to loop the current episode. You can also ask for previous and next episodes by saying \"Alexa, previous\" and \"Alexa, next\". This skill was created using a Skill Blueprint. Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer.\nThe Cathedral of Hope Devotion Ministry began as an answer to Progressive Christians who wanted to start their days with a little insight, observation, or wisdom about the Christian faith from their own point of view. Conservative internet devotions were abundant, but there was not much out there for liberal thinkers. The need was clear. Being a large church, we had a generous amount of writing talent available and also a large number of congregants with theological training who were not on the pulpit. In the early days of the ministry, most of the writing was done by the clergy, but gradually the majority of the writers emerged from those lay volunteers. That dynamic is still in place as new authors are always joining in to keep the ideas fresh. It\u2019s a fitting structure for any center of progressive thought. This particular Body of Christ has many voices and each one has a unique and important story to tell.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
