LLIF uniquely combines your life events with your activities, environment, and monitors to help you identify triggers, detect trends, find anomalies, and achieve goals. LLIF replaces the need for separate activity, mood, pain, diary, pollen, medication, health, menstrual cycle, migraine, depression, anxiety, etc. trackers. Your digital life starts with LLIF. Thank you for joining LLIF to achieve your best life. \n\nEvents are simply phrases that are used to track and correlate against your other data. The common event types are primarily symptoms initially but over time, we will incorporate food, drink medication, supplements, treatments, symptoms, pain, activities, emotions, etc. Common events are headache, stomach ache, congestion, migraine, back pain, neck pain, antibiotic, smoke, friend-name, window open, slept with dog, melatonin, etc.\n\nUse cases are only limited to your imagination when it comes to voice event logging. Examples include:\n\n-- If you experience migraines, you could record them by speaking \"Alexa, ask Best Life to log 'migraine'\". LLIF will then be able to correlate your migraines against your environment (weather, air, pollen, place, etc.) to determine likely triggers or combinations of triggers like abrupt barometric pressure changes.\n\n-- If you want to know if melatonin helps you sleep and you have a sleep tracker then you could record taking melatonin by speaking, \"Alexa, ask best life to log 'melatonin'\", you will be able to determine whether melatonin helps you sleep better. You could even log \"melatonin ten\" or \"melatonin three\" to determine your best dose of melatonin. \n\n-- If you're struggling to identify triggers for seizures, you'll want to log seizure with your robust environment and future nutrition data to identify situations where they are more likely even if stress is a contributor.\n\n-- If you suffer from allergies, you'll not only be able to identify whether it is pollen but the the specific type of pollen based on satellite machine learning techniques.\n\n-- If you discover new ways of using your Best Life to improve your life, we'd like to know.
