His interest is in what the Bible actually says and does not say. He uses common sense and scholarship to interpret the passages. He is acquainted with what commentators and denominations say, but not limited by denominational distinctives that divide the body of Christ. While he is well read, he is free to be led by Scripture and the Holy Spirit. For details, read his full biography.\n\nWhen asked a question about a passage, Steve usually lists its several interpretations, gives the reasoning behind each, cross-examines each, and then tells his own conclusions and reasons. He tries to teach how to read and reason about the Bible, not what to think. Education, not indoctrination.\n\nSteve has learned on his own. He did not attend a seminary or Bible college, but he was awarded a Ph.D. for his work by Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary in Evansville, Indiana. He is the author of two books:\n\n(1) All You Want to Know about Hell: Three Christian Views of God's Final Solution to the Problem of Sin\n\n(2) Revelation: Four Views, Revised & Updated\n\n\nOnce enabled, you can listen to the most recent episode by saying, \"Alexa, play The Narrow Path.\"\n\nTo pause or resume any episode, say \"Alexa, pause\" or \"Alexa, resume.\" To listen to previous episodes, say \"Alexa, play the previous episode.\" If you want to know the title of an episode while the episode is playing, say \"Alexa, ask The Narrow Path for the title of this episode.\" If you want to know the air date of an episode, say \"Alexa, ask The Narrow Path for the date of this episode.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
