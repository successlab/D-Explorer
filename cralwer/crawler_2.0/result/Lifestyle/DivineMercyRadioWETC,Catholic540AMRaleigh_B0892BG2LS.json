Our mission is to strengthen Catholics in their faith, to invite fallen-away Catholics back to the faith, and to inform non-Catholics of the gospel of Jesus through programming which proclaims His message of truth, mercy, and love. Programs are provided by Catholic organizations on faith and life issues for all ages. You can pause and play by saying \"Alexa, pause\" and \"Alexa, resume.\" Just say \"Alexa, stop\" when you're done for the day. This skill was created using a Skill Blueprint. Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer.\n\nDivine Mercy Radio spreads the knowledge, love, and practice of the Roman Catholic Faith by means of radio. Our programming content is therefore primarily educational, catechetical, devotional, and inspirational.\n\nDivine Mercy Radio exists in response to the call of the Second Vatican Council to the laity to evangelize, and to its call to use the media to this effect. Divine Mercy Radio declares an absolute faithfulness to the Holy Father and the Bishops in union with him. We are bound to accurately and fully transmit the Faith as proposed by the Teaching Authority of the Church. We are specifically bound by the vehicle in which it is proposed for our time, the Catechism of the Catholic Church. These qualities shape our service to the faithful in the Raleigh Diocese in which we broadcast, our obedience to our bishop, and our assistance to local priests and religious.\n\nDivine Mercy Radio is committed to bringing you 24 hours of uplifting messages, compassionate answers and sure guidance for living a holier, Catholic life.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
