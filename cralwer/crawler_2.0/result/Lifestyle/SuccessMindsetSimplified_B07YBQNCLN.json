Yes, hard work, effort, and persistence are all important, but not as important as having that underlying belief that you are in control of you.Whether you define success as the achievement of an external set of circumstances, such as the achievement of goals, or define it as an internal state such as peace and bliss, both definitions require a mindset which is conductive to them, a mindset harmonious with them. The reason behind this is, our mindset is fused with how we have come to define ourselves, how we see our reality", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
