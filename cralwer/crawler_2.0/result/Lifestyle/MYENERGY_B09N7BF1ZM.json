Every 90 \u2013 120 minutes our heart rate, hormonal levels, muscle tension and brain activity all increase, and so do our alertness and productivity. After a period of peak performance, the brainwaves slow down and we hit a low when we feel dreamy or tired and struggle to focus.\nMY ENERGY leverages over 70 years of scientific research, helping users identify the times of their highs & lows to enjoy a less stressful, more productive life.\n\nThe process has 3 steps:\nFIRST, the voice bot will ask, what time your tracking should begin and end. This period should cover the active part of your day, ideally \u2014 most of the time you\u2019re awake, at least \u2014 5 hours.\nTHEN, for 3 days, MY ENERGY will ping you within those hours, asking to rate your energy level on a scale 1\u201310. Each interaction will take seconds, but collect valuable data points for your graph.\nAFTER 3 days, the app will email you a graph, visualising your responses, calling out the times of your highs & lows and offer actionable tips to ride your highs and adapt to your lows.\n\nHow to use\n1. Ask Alexa to \u201cOpen MY ENERGY\u201d.\n2. Carefully listen to instructions.\n3. Tell MY ENERGY what what time you\u2019d like to receive your first and last pings of the day.\n3. During those hours, for 3 days, MY ENERGY will prompt you to rate your energy levels. Please respond as instructed \u2014 with a number between 1 and 10.\n4. To save time, you can also respond without opening the app. Just say \u201cAlexa, tell My Energy, I feel like 10\u201d if you\u2019re super-productive, OR \u201c1\u201d if you\u2019re sleepy and easily distracted.\n5. At the end of day 3, user receives a report where her responses are put onto a graph with times of highs & lows highlighted.\n6. The goal of the first-time usage, is to identify at least one low. After adapting to it (see tips included in the report), it is advisable to repeat the exercise every 1\u20142 months.\nPlease remember: the graph is only useful if based on sufficient data. If the gaps between responses surpass 90 minutes and/or less than 3 days are measured, the report is unlikely to offer actionable conclusions.\n\nPossible commands\n\u201cAlexa, open MY ENERGY\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, tell MY ENERGY {energy rate 1\u201410}\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, tell MY ENERGY, I want to learn more\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, tell MY ENERGY help\u201d\n\u201cAlexa, tell MY ENERGY restart the game\u201d\n\nSupport\nMY ENERGY is in active development.
