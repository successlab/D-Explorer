Have you ever struggled to pick a jacket? Felt underdressed or overdressed when you are outside your sweet house? Have no worries from now! Alexa can help you. This skill is designed to recommend you a perfect jacket based on the outside weather.\n\nWhen you try out the skill for the first, you are asked to list the jackets you have, from lightest to heaviest, in terms of protection level. You need to list by saying - \"I have \u2026\". Then you are asked a question about the city. Please mention it likewise below example: If you are living in New York, then say - \"New York\". Once you answer such questions, the Alexa skill will recommend you a jacket.
