Every time that you tell Garden Buddy that you watered a plant, it becomes a little better at giving advice on when you should water next. Each plant is tracked separately in Garden Buddy, meaning you can keep individual watering logs for six plants!\n\nTo tell Garden Buddy to begin tracking a plant you can say \"add a \" followed by the plant name. Once the plant is added Garden buddy will begin tracking your watering patterns.\n\nEvery time you water a plant just say \"I watered the \" followed by the plant name. Once you tell Garden Buddy about two times that you water a plant it will begin to analyze how often you water, and when you should water next.\n\nYou can ask Garden Buddy what plants need water by saying \"what plants need water?\" Alternatively, you can ask \"when was the (plant's name) watered?\" if you want to know the time of the last watering for a specific plant.\n\nIf you realize that you have been forgetting to tell Garden Buddy when you water a plant, or you realize that you've been watering too much or not enough, you can reset the plant's statistics by saying \"reset the \" followed by the plant name. \n\nGarden Buddy does not give watering advice based on plant types. Instead, it learns how often your plants receive water based on the past watering log. That means that the longer you use Garden Buddy, the smarter it becomes!\n\nHappy planting!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
