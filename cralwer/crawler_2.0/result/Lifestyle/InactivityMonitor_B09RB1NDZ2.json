This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: my inactivity monitor", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "\"Alexa, ask my inactivity monitor to set time to monitor for 2 hours.\" If no activity is detected by the Blink Camera in the next 2 hours, CareRinger will call to check in, to make sure nothing went wrong.\n\nTo monitor inactivity continuously, create 2 routines to automate some custom actions in this skill. These actions are triggered very time the motion sensor detects an activity.\n\n1) A first routine checks for inactivity. It asks the CareRinger service to initiate a check-in call when there is no activity detected for a period of time. To implement, the action \"ask my inactivity monitor to set time to monitor for {duration}\" is added to the end of this routine, where {duration} is the time in hour and/or minute set for the monitor timer.\n\n2) A second routine monitors the presence of activity and will remove all pending calls, if any, when activity is detected. To implement, the action \"ask my inactivity monitor to check in early\" is added to the end of this routine to reset the timer.\n\n* Additional routines can be added to further customize the monitor depending on the needs. For information about creating Alexa routines and using Blink Camera to trigger the routines, please refer to Alexa documentation online.\n\nTo verify the actions to use in your routines, you can schedule a check-in call by saying \"Alexa, ask my careringer monitor to set time to monitor for {duration}\". Or initiate a call by saying \"Alexa, ask my careringer monitor to call now\". CareRinger will call to check in at the time of your choosing. Your designated contact(s) will be notified when the check-in call is not answered.\nYou can also say \"Alexa, ask my careringer monitor\" to start a conversation with Alexa. It will let you know if you have any pending check-in calls and ask you what to do if there is one or more pending. You can say \"check in early\" to remove all the pending check-in calls and reset the monitor timer to its original state.\n\nThis is a less verbose version of the skill. There are other more verbose versions for this application.\n\nTo begin, you need to register for the CareRinger service.
