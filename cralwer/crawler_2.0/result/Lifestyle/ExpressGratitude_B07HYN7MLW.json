But sometimes expressing gratitude is hard, and it can feel awkward when you try to tell people you're grateful for them.\n\nThis skill will give you a new Gratitude Goal each day in your Flash Briefing to help you get in the habit of expressing gratitude. These goals go beyond simply thinking grateful thoughts, and they will challenge you to actually express gratitude to the people in your life.\n\nBy expressing gratitude in person (or on the phone, through text, or even email) you magnify the positive effects on your own mindset while also improving your relationships and giving that positivity back to the people you care about.\n\nIn each briefing you will also get tips and advice on how to meet your Gratitude Goal. These tips will include how to make expressing gratitude feel more natural and less awkward, how to get in the habit of expressing gratitude without even thinking about it, and even simply getting better at figuring out what you're grateful for.\n\nWE LOVE GRATITUDE TOO\nExpress Gratitude is part of Next Level Living's mission to help everyone live happier and more meaningful lives.
