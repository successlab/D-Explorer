Shirdi Sai Baba was a revered spiritual master. Sai Satcharitra is considered by Sai devotees as a sacred book and many believe that Sai Baba himself wrote this book using Sri. Hemadpant as means. There are two sections in this app. Namely, 1. Sai Baba Sayings 2. Sai Satcharitra Quiz\n\nThe quintessence of Sai's life is about, forgiveness, charity, inner peace, devotion, helping others, realization of the self, devotion to the God, Guru, and contentment. We collected some notable, inspiring, enlightening, motivating and thought-provoking quotes and sayings by Shirdi Sai Baba. We hope you will enjoy these sayings!\n\nAdditionally, We designed Sai Satcharitra quiz to help Sai devotees enhance their knowledge of Sai Satcharitra rather than leaving a feeling about either they know or do not know. For this reason, we removed the \"option\" to make \"selection\" and hence request users to mentally make a selection from the choices to each question and answer will follow after a 2 seconds pause.\nSai Answers is part of our popular Shirdi Sai Baba All-In-One App that is available across all app stores and is by OmniSai.Org, a US 501(C)(3) Nonprofit Organization.
