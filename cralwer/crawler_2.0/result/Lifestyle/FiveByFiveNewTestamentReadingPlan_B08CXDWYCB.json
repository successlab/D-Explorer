This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: five bye five", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "This skill used the Navigators 5x5 Plan (5 minutes a day, 5 times a week) to read through the New Testament. When a user first uses the skill, it will start day one. The skill will keep track of a user's progress so each time the user opens it on a new day, a new chapter will play. This skill also supports individual voice profiles and allows different members of a Household to keep their place in the reading schedule.\n\nIf a user opens the skill again on the same day it will repeat that day's reading.\n\nIf a user wants to reset the plan they can say, 'Go back to the beginning' to go back to the beginning of the plan. If they want to move to a different passage they can say, 'I want to hear something else' to be prompted to read another passage. The schedule will then be updated with the selection.\n\nA link to the Navigator's 5x5x5 Plan can be found here: https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/navtool-5x5x5.pdf", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
