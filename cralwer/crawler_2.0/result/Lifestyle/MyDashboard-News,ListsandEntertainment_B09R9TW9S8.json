Please note that all rates are for information purposes only. They are not intended to be used for investment decisions)\n\nIf the displayed content (for example in the case of news or long lists) does not fit into a widget, then it can be moved up and down by touch.\n\nThe widgets are placed over the standard screen, Alexa can then continue to be used as usual. However, if a native Alexa feature displays different content on the screen, then the skill needs to be restarted.\n\nIf you want to specifically end the display of the widgets, you can do this, for example, with the command \"Alexa, open home page\".\n\nBoth more detailed and up to date information can be found on https://mydashboard.applicate.de\n\nHint: the skill is well suited to be included in an Alexa routine.\n\nThe widgets are not yet configurable. That should follow in a later version.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
