This is a simple skill that contains the 42 rules for life that Jordan Peterson had originally posted on Quora. You can listen to these rules as part of a healthy mourning routine, or as a reminder throughout the day. Some of the rules have been slightly elaborated on to make their meanings clearer (originally, I added these elaborations to help my younger siblings understand the rules). I hope that you enjoy this simple skill. Thanks!", "priv": ""}
