Edited by Stephen Mark Holmes (University of Edinburgh School of Divinity) Pluscarden Abbey, Scotland\n\nThe aim of the Two Year Patristic Lectionary is thus:\n\nTo have each patristic reading either related to the Scripture reading or to the season of the Church's year.\n\nTo have a reading for every day of the Temporal cycle (i.e. including days such as Christmas, Ascension, Sacred Heart).\n\nTo have the vast majority of the 'patristic' readings from the Fathers of the Church, although following medieval precedent writers such as Origen have been included. This gives it ecumenical value.\n\nTo use readings from the one year cycle in the Divine Office and the two year cycle of Word in Season whenever possible.\n\nTo include the texts of a complete two-year Scripture cycle, as approved by the Holy See, for use with the patristic readings.\n\n\nThe lectionary is in use in monasteries in Scotland, England, the USA, Ghana and South Africa. We hope that its inclusion as a free resource on the website of the Durham University Centre for Catholic Studies will enable it to be of use to the wider Church beyond the monasteries of the Benedictine Confederation.\n\nThe History of the Patristic Lectionary\nA 'patristic lectionary' is a series of readings from the fathers (in Latin patres) of the Church. Scripture has always been read in the Church in the context of tradition. With the development of the Divine Office (services of prayer celebrated at different times of each day) the daily cycle of Scripture reading came to be accompanied by commentaries from the fathers of the Church, as St Benedict wrote in the middle of the sixth century, 'Let the inspired books of both the Old and the New Testaments be read at Vigils, as also commentaries on them by the most eminent orthodox and catholic fathers' (Rule of Benedict, IX). The main surviving early Latin collections of readings from the fathers, or patristic lectionaries, are those of Alan of Farfa and Paul the Deacon from the eighth century. These formed the basis of the patristic lectionary used in the Roman Breviary and many other Latin Breviaries. Over time the readings from the fathers were cut back in length with no thought to their meaning. Attempts were made to improve the patristic lectionary by Cardinal Qui\u00f1onez in the sixteenth century, the monks of Cluny in the seventeenth century and Archbishop Vintimille of Paris in the eighteenth, but the inadequate patristic lectionary of the Breviarium Romanum (1568) and Breviarium Monasticum (1612) continued in use until the Second Vatican Council (1962-65).\n\nThis skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
