It's easy for your neck and shoulder muscles to tense and tighten, especially with repetitive motions like looking down at your phone all the time.\n\nBody Works: Neck Shoulder is a step-by-step guide for a 5-minute stretch you can perform at the office, when you get out of bed\u2026 or even at the bus stop (if you don't mind some stares)!\n\nTell Alexa:\n - \"Alexa, Pause\" anytime to take a breather. Say \"Alexa, Resume\" when you are ready to keep going.\n - Say \"Alexa, Next\" to go to the next set, or \"Alexa, Go Back\" to restart the previous set.\n - Go past 5-minute marks with \"Alexa, Loop On\", and \"Alexa, Loop Off\" to finish out the routine.\n - Stuck in a rut? Say \"Alexa, Shuffle\" to change up the routine! \"Alexa, Shuffle Off\" to go back to our curated sequence.\n\nFull version currently features three different routines so you won't have to repeat the same set every day.\n\nContact us for any suggestions and feedback at bodyworkswonder@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer : The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
