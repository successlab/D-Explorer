We work hard and we don't necessarily feel appreciated, but we need to know, every test is building us. Every ounce of effort we put in to serving Hashem will be heavily rewarded in the Future.\"\n\n\"Emunah gives a person strength and courage and enables him to stand up and face even the biggest challenges. And when we respond with emunah, we inspire people around us.\"\n\n\"Hashem gives us all countless blessings, and He is constantly protecting us from harm. Sometimes we complain when we feel lacking, but if we would focus more on how much Hashem is doing for us, there wouldn\u2019t be any room for complaints.\"\n\nThese quotes are inspired and summarized from classes by rabbi David Ashear.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
