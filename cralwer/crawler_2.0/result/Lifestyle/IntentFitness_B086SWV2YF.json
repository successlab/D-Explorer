We ask five questions based on the user-chosen category. After the user is done answering these questions, we start a workout routine for the user to perform, the number of exercises in the workout routine is based on the user's score in the quiz. \n\nOnce the user is done with the workout routine, he/she has the choice to either continue with the same category or choose a different category of questions, and the cycle continues. This makes the user physically fit, as well as increases the user's knowledge base.\n\nHere are the things you can say once you initialize the skill.\n\nRepeat/Say Again - To hear the question again\nHelp - To get detailed instructions\n\nGood luck!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
