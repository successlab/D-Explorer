This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: beautiful adhan", "reviewnum": " 100", "des": "This \"Beautiful Azan\" app lets you play formal Muslim call to Prayer (Adhan, Azan, Athan) with the best sound quality and heart touching 5 different reciter beautiful voices to choose from. The app will choose a random Adhan (Azan, Athan) as soon as you launch the app and say different keyphrases (intents). If you have lived somewhere where there is no Masjid (Mosque) nearby, this would be a great app to listen to Azan on Salah(Namaz) times. There is a live Azan recording and you may hear some noises in the background but I found the voice beautiful so I added it too.\nIf you'd like to listen to the Fajar Adhan please ask Alexa to play Fajar Adhan as Fajar Azan is different to other normal Azan, Adhan. \nExample phrases you can say to Alexa:\nAlexa, open Beautiful Adhan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play Fajar Adhan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play Fajar Azan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play Fajar Athan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play Adhan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play a different Azan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play different Adhan\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play an amazing Adhan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play Beautiful Azan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to play the new Azan.\nAlexa, ask Beautiful Adhan to Play Azan.\nOr just say \"Azan\" or \"play Azan\" after you've launched the skill.\n\nFeedback / Getting in touch with us:\nThis is the first ever app I have created and never made anything similar to this before.
