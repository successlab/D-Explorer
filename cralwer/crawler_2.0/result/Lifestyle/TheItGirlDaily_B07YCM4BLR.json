A true It Girl wants to be it all and do it all. She's limitless. She pushes herself to be better in all aspects of her life. Here on the It Girl Daily, we talk about how fashion and style impacts your life, your confidence, and ultimately where you're going.\n\nBig stuff, huh?\n\nBut we'll break it down together and figure it out. Because if you want it, you should be able to be it.\n\nEvery day, we'll talk about fashion trends, style secrets, and inspirational lifestyle topics that will help you live your best life. We cover topics ranging from picking the perfect pair of high heels for work to how many of the same pairs of pants are too many. We also talk about other aspects of our outward appearance too. It all plays a part in how we see ourselves and how others see us. Unlock your potential by starting with you!\n\nJoin me, Jules, every day as I break down these life hacks through fashion. I can't wait to be friends and take this journey together!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
