I\u2019ve developed a very simple framework that can help you to reprogram that negative self-talk.\n\nBecause the last thing you want it to do is to manifest into some physical illness or to keep you safe from living your best life or building that dream business and If you\u2019d like me to take you through this framework so you can end that self-talk too, connect with me on Instagram @SelfTalkRemedy - I\u2019d love to help you with this.\n\n(The information in this skill/briefing is provided for informational and educational purposes only)", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
