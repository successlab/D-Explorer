You'll \"walk\" along as the various animals are fed, a tractor passes by, and a gentle summer thunderstorm rolls in. If you are able, listen with a surround-sound device, though this is optional. The national television show Market to Market at Iowa PBS created this for our viewers, especially those who work or once worked the land. But all will enjoy the relaxing natural and manmade sounds of a mid-twentieth-century farm. We would especially like this to help those who may, for various reasons, no longer be able to set foot on that farm they once loved, whether that's due to dementia, physical injury, limited abilities or a simple move to another place.
