You then personalize that patch by providing your recipient\u2019s first name, and your name and city. Once you\u2019re happy with the patch, it gives you a location of it on the quilt. This is simply a name of a state along with a four-digit number. \n\nIf someone has created a patch for you, they will share its location. This makes it easy to find. Just ask to find a patch, then provide its location.\n\nTo get a sense of what others are creating, ask to see a random patch. You\u2019ll also be able to move up or down to hear a few, or all of the patches on Quilt of Gratitude!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
