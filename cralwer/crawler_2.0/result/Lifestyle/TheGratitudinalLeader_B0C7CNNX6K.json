Scientific research shows that gratefulness enhances your organizational and motivating abilities.\n\nGrateful mentors turn out to be far better mentors than those who play by strict rules.\n\nMoreover, this positive practice tends to improve our patience and decision-making processes by shifting our focus from short-term gratifications to long-term goals. This is particularly important when it comes to work and office culture, as following short-term goals leads to confusion and chaos.\n\nOn the other hand, focusing on long-term goals gives us more meaning, both in terms of workplace relationships and professional aspirations.\n\nGratitude Improves Work Satisfaction\n\nLuckily, positive psychology has made an impact on career development and counseling. That\u2019s why today we have a rich body of empirical research about traits and habits that are related to overall work satisfaction.\n\nRecent research from 2015 revealed that gratitude is one of the most important factors that impact people\u2019s sense of meaning at work. Grateful people seem to be the ones who end up \u201cliving their life\u2019s purpose\u201d, plus, they\u2019re happier at their workplace.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Implementing gratitude practice at work significantly improves employees\u2019 mental health and reduces their perceived stress and depressive symptoms at work. Gratitude turns out to be a protective factor, improving people\u2019s resilience in all kinds of stressful situations.\n\n - About the Author - \n\nTEDX SPEAKER, SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR, CEO, FOUNDER, MENTOR AND LEADER BUILDING MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESSES.\n\nHe is the author or co-author of eight books including: Uncharted Waters (Boat to Boardroom; lessons I\u2019ve Learned); Do Something: Leave Your Mark on the World; The Detachment Paradox, and Chemical-Free Kids: How to Safeguard Your Child\u2019s Diet and Environment. \n\nAnthony and his wife, Kathleen, have five children and six grandchildren.
