The show and flash briefings are based on Tony's experience over years of coaching and counseling younger adults and professionals who have finally realized there is more to life than just existing and collecting a paycheck. It's all about personal responsibility, accountability, leadership and wanting to figure out the reason why your are here so you can sharpen that skill and share it with the world. Past and present clients as well as listeners of the broadcast are amp34do'ersamp34 ... it's all about ACTION ... how to plan for it, how to start the process, how to make adjustments and how to finally make it happen. This show and these flash briefings are not for the beginner...not for the amateur personal growth person....it's for those of us who have put the time in and know, with blind certainty, that we have a job to do that will make the world a better place for everyone.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
