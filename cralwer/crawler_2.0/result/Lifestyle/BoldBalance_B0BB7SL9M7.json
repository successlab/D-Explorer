The user starts the interaction by telling Alexa that they would like to check their balance. Following this, Alexa takes the user through a series of four questions, adapted from the CDC\u2019s STEADI protocol to assess balance. These questions evaluate the user\u2019s history of falling, attitude towards falling, and ability to hold a number of unsupported standing positions for 10 seconds. For each question the user responds Yes or No to proceed. Upon completion of the question series, Alexa responds with an assessment of the user\u2019s balance as below average, average, or above average. The final response also includes some recommendations about things that the user can do to improve their balance - including balance training exercises and environmental modifications.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
