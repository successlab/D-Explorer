The possibilities are endless!\n\nWant some ideas on what to cook, drink, or activities to do - List Shuffler is here to help! And better still it suggests from your preferred options, not some random things from the internet.\n\nJust create a list with a suitable name(for example cook, drink, activity, etc) and add it with your preferred items. Then you can simply ask list shuffler to suggest something to cook, or pick something to drink, or for some activity.\n\nAnd since this relies on Alexa's standard lists, you can manage the lists just like you do it now. Just ask Alexa to add or remove items or to create new lists.\n\nGetting Started\n * Enable the skills\n * Grant permissions to access the list from your Alexa app. If not the skill will notify you and bring up the permissions consent card in your alexa app (in activities).\n * Setup your list and populate it (use alexa app or alexa's inbuilt commands for this). Note that the skill will try to find with exact name, else try to do a partial name match ie if you ask for something to 'cook', it can find it in any list containing cook, for example in cook, cooks, cooking (but not vice versa, ie can't find cooking if the list name is called cook)\n * Begin using the skill", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
