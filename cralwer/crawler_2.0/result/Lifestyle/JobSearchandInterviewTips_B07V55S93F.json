I'd love for you to join my Alexa Flash Briefing where we will cover what it takes to conduct a strategic modern job search. \n\nI help high achieving professionals break out of antiquated job search molds, and break into creative agencies, startups, corporations, and non profit organizations in the most competitive job markets in the country\u2013\u2013so that they can reach higher levels of earning potential and career satisfaction. My former clients have landed roles at top companies like Google, Starbucks, Medtronic, Deloitte and more. \n\nI'm not a \"woo-woo\", touchy feely career coach.

You can count on my tips to be practical, actionable and based in research. \n\nPrior to starting my resume writing and interview coaching business, www.briefcasecoach.com, I was a corporate recruiter. I've literally interviewed thousands of job seekers and know what it takes to be successful.\n\nI was named a \"Top Follow on LinkedIn\" by JobScan in 2019 and have been in Inc, HuffPost, Medium, Reader's Digest, Moneyish and more. \n\nI'm rooting for you!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
