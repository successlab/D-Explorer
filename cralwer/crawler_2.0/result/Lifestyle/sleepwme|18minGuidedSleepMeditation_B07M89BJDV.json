Pro Athletes like Lebron James or Roger Federer try to get at least 10 hours of sleep each day in order to perform at the highest level for several years. \n\nINSOMNIA\nHowever, about 30% of adults suffer from some form of insomnia. Extensive research shows sleep deprivation increases one\u2019s risk of injuries, reduces muscle building and recovery, and, if it becomes a chronic practice, triggers health consequences that are much more severe (risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease). \n\nTECHNOLOGY\nUnfortunately, your smartphone might be the biggest root cause for this problem: the LED screen emits blue light which suppresses melatonin (a hormone that affects circadian rhythm and should increase when you are preparing for bedtime), your brain is therefore negatively stimulated and causes you to have troubles falling asleep.\n\nSLEEP WITH ME\nInstead of counting sheep, we therefore offer you a skill that will foster relaxation when you lay in bed sleepless.
