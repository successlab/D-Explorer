The prior incarnations of Dattatreya (Divine Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Siva) include Shripada Shri Vallabha (around 1320 A.D \u2013 1350 A.D) and Shri Narasimha Saraswati (around 1378 A.D \u2013 1458 A.D). \n\nDuring Saibaba\u2019s lifetime in Shirdi, Sai Baba used to request some of his ardent devotees to read Guru Charitra (by Sri Saraswati Gangadhar Sakhare based on life story of Shri Narasimha Saraswati) and blessed them. To date, Sai devotees across the world read Guru Charitra with same fervor as they love and read Sai Satcharitra. They both (Sai Satchritra and Guru Charitra) in essence impart the same light & teachings but written during different time periods. We suggest all Sai devotees to listen, assimilate and drink the nectar of this holy book!
