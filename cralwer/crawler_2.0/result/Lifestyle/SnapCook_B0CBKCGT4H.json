SnapCook acts as an audio-based cookbook providing you with recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even snack foods that you can make quickly at home. No need to worry about having dirty hands when trying to scroll through your phone or physical cookbook, simply use your voice to navigate the recipe selections and cook without restrictions. \n\nTo access SnapCook, simply say \"Alexa, open SnapCook,\" and start your cooking journey with ease. Once you've opened SnapCook, you can say \"Breakfast,\" \"Lunch,\" \"Dinner,\" or \"Snack\" to choose the type of recipes that you want to make. SnapCook will read you different recipe options for the type of meal that you selected, and all you have to do is say \"yes\" or \"no\" to make your choice. Once the recipe is picked, SnapCook will read you the recipe steps one by one, allowing you to control the pace of the directions by saying \"next\" when you're ready to move on, or even \"repeat\" when you need to hear the instructions again. You have the ability to control the process. \n\nTo use SnapCook, you need an Alexa enabled device. This is a skill designed for people of all ages. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Add SnapCook to your Alexa skills and start cooking!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
