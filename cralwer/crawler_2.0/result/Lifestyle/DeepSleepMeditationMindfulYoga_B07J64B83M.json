Think of it like exercising a muscle that gets stronger over time. \n\nIn fact, \"Mindful Yoga\", the practice of intentionally quieting or focusing the mind, creates physiological changes that are similar to those that happen in your body during the early phases of sleep. Your pulse slows, blood pressure drops, and stress hormones decrease. Being able to get to that state on demand means that you\u2019ll have an easier time drifting off when you want to. \n\nNote: This skill does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purpose only and is not substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
