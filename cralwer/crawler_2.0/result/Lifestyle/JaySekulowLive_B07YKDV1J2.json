He is also Chief Counsel of the European Center for Law and Justice (ECLJ) based in Strasbourg, France, and the Slavic Center for Law and Justice (SCLJ) in Moscow, Russia. The ACLJ also has an affiliate office in Jerusalem, Israel. \n\nAn accomplished and respected judicial advocate, Sekulow has presented oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court in twelve cases in defense of constitutional freedoms. Several landmark cases argued by Sekulow before the U.S. Supreme Court have become part of the legal landscape in the area of religious liberty litigation; these cases include Mergens, Lamb's Chapel, McConnell v. FEC, Operation Rescue v. National Organization for Women, and most recently Pleasant Grove City v. Summum.\n\nIn 2009, Townhall Magazine named Sekulow to its \"Townhall of Fame\" and recognized him as \"one of the top lawyers for religious freedom in the United States.\" In 2007, the Chicago Tribune concluded that the ACLJ has \"led the way\" in Christian legal advocacy. In 2005, TIME Magazine named Sekulow as one of the \"25 Most Influential Evangelicals\" in America and called the ACLJ \"a powerful counterweight\" to the ACLU. Business Week said the ACLJ is \"the leading advocacy group for religious freedom.\" Sekulow's work on the issue of judicial nominees, including possible vacancies at the Supreme Court, has received extensive news coverage, including a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal. In addition, The National Law Journal has twice named Sekulow one of the \"100 Most Influential Lawyers\" in the United States (1994, 1997). He is also among a distinguished group of attorneys known as \"The Public Sector 45\" named by The American Lawyer (January/February 1997). The magazine said the designation represents \"45 young lawyers outside the private sector whose vision and commitment are changing lives.\"\n\nSekulow brings insight and education to listeners daily with his national call-in radio program, Jay Sekulow Live!, which is broadcast throughout the country on nearly 850 radio stations.
