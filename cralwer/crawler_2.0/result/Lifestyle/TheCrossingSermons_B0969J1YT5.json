Our mission is to move the hearts and minds of more people to believe Jesus is more. We want to be a church where we can genuinely encounter God and grow in our relationship with him. We believe that, in doing this, two things happen: God is honored, and our lives become much more joyful and satisfying.\n\nAt The Crossing, our goal is to be an authentic community known for our transparency, integrity, and sincerity of heart. We want to serve God by creating an environment that allows people to be who they are \u2013 both as they are first introduced to Jesus and as they grow to be more like him. Our vision is for the transformation of the whole person and the whole of life.\n\nThis kind of growth best happens within safe, non-threatening relationships that allow us to be \u201cin process\u201d while still challenging us to continue to grow. We need each other to help us believe the gospel and apply it to our lives. When we\u2019re not in relationships where our unbelief is being challenged, it is nearly impossible to experience significant spiritual growth.\n\nOur Sunday morning worship service is the best way to get an idea of what The Crossing is about. You can join us in our building in Columbia, Missouri or on our live stream. While the worship service is central to everything we do, being involved in this church means much more than coming on Sunday mornings. \n\nGet a feel for our values and community by worshiping with us during live services, watching past sermons, and learning about how God is working in our church family through our Stories of Change. All of these are available on The Crossing app.\n\nFor more information, join us online at thecrossingchurch.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
