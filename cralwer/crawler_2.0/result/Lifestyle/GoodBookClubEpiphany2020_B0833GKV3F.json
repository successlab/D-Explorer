The Good Book Club returns for a third year with the Gospel of John. We\u2019ll read the compelling account\u2014inspired by \u201cthe disciple whom Jesus loved\u201d\u2014during the time from Epiphany through Shrove Tuesday.\n\nOf course, we are familiar with the most famous verse of John 3:16, but our Good Book Club focus gives us an opportunity to read the extraordinary gospel from start to finish. We\u2019ll hear stories only heard in John: Jesus turns water into wine at the wedding of Cana, encounters the woman at the well, and raises Lazarus from the dead.\n\nThe spiritual Gospel of John uses beautiful poetry: Jesus as the bread of life and as the vine. And it\u2019s in John that we hear the great I AM statements.\n\nWe\u2019re excited for this journey through John. Make plans now to join Forward Movement and more than a dozen partner organizations from across the Episcopal Church to encounter the risen Lord through the signs and wonders, the beauty and revelation of John\u2019s Gospel.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
