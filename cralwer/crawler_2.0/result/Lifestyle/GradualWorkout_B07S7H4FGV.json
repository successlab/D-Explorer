No stress, no after pain, no fear. Just good habit forming exercise.\n\nGradual workout is a slow paced incremental build up of four key strength building areas, pushups for your chest, situps for your abdominal muscles, squats for your quads and lunges for your knees and glutes. When launching the skill for the first time, you select a starting rep level and each day you will need to complete that many reps until a week has passed and your rep level will be increased by one. So if you start on a rep level of five, then this time next year you will be pumping out fifty-seven reps on a daily basis. \n\nThis skill will keep track of your rep level assuming you have been keeping with the daily routine. If you slip on the schedule then simply say \"Alexa, reset my workout\".\n\nYou can also go to https://gradualworkout.com to keep track of your reps.\n\nAt the end of each activity you will be asked if you have completed the reps, if you say yes then you move onto the next exercise, if you say no then you will get another thirty seconds to finish off your reps. The rep time is calculated using a centralized algorithm, so you may finish early or late depending on your pace.\n\nHere are some things you can say to alexa during your workout:\n\n\"Alexa, turn off the music\" (or turn on the music) : toggles the workout music on/off\n\"Alexa, next\": skip to the next workout (in case you finish early)\n\"Alexa, reset my workout\" : allows you to reset your number of reps (useful if you have missed a few weeks or decide to level yourself up)\n\"Alexa, help\" : gives a recap on how the skill works\n\"Alexa, stop (cancel, exit)\" : close the skill\n\nPlease provide feedback to steven.bowden@protonmail.com or in the comments below.\n\nImportant information\nHealth\nDon't attempt these exercises if you are not confident in your approach or have medical risks associated with strenuous physical activity. Please confirm with a relevant professional if you are not confident you can complete these exercises safely.\n\nPrivacy\nThe Gradual Workout skill stores your initial rep level and the time when you set that rep level.
