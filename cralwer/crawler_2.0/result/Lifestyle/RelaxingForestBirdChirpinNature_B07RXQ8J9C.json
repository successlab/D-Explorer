Find out how the natural sounds featured in the \u201cFocus on Work\u201d music soundtrack can help relieve stress and make us more productive on the job. Are noise and distractions in the workplace keeping you from getting your job done?\n\nTreat yourself to some much-needed concentration-time with this Alexa skill which will help you to relax and focus on work. Lots of people have already reviewed it \u2013 and they\u2019re saying great things. I just received an email from an employee who works in an open-office environment and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how this works, but it does \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing!\u201d I appreciate the comment, and I agree that \u201cFocus on Work\u201d is a great tool for getting more done on the job.\n\nSoothing Sounds to Lift Our Mood\u2026 and Productivity\n\nMost experts agree that music can have a powerful effect on our well-being. Studies show that listening to soothing sounds lifts our mood, calms our nerves, and alleviates the perception of pain. So it\u2019s natural to expect that this type of music would have a powerful effect on us in the workplace as well.\n\nInstitutions have begun to put this logic to work. A primary school in Liverpool played a soundscape of birdsong and other nature sounds after a lunch break when students would normally be drowsy. This appeared to help them concentrate and become more alert. And birdsong is now used at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where a lounge plays bird sounds to help travelers relax before flights.\n\nOther sound experts have a different theory on why bird songs tend to relax us. They believe that it\u2019s because they\u2019re stochastic \u2013 made up of lots of random sounds \u2013 with no repeating rhythm or pattern. Because of this randomness, our brain tends not to focus on the song itself but rather the task at hand.\n\nNow contrast those loud noises to the softer sounds of birds singing. Many experts are convinced that these sounds are reassuring to humans because over thousands of years of evolution we\u2019ve learned that the sweet melody of birds merrily singing is an indication that our environment is safe.\n\n\n\nDAILY Relaxing Forest Bird Chirp in Nature ROUTINE\nTo add this sounds to a daily timer, follow these steps:\n1 - Open your Alexa App.\n2 - Select Routines.\n3 - Select Schedule, add a time (say 7 AM).\n4 - Choose Skills / Your Skills.\n5 - Choose 'Relaxing Forest Bird Chirp in Nature'.
