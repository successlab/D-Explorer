How does this work? \n\nHaving someone read your writing back to you is an incredibly helpful tool when reviewing your written work. We discovered this while testing some of our own writing on some of the newer, more realistic A.I. voices out there. \n\nWe found more typos,\nwe more easily identified awkward phrasing,\nour word choices seemed to get more creative,\nand our writing more concise.\nIt even seemed to help us brainstorm new ideas.\n\nQuickly, we realized that this should be developed into an app.\n\nMore testing showed lower quality, more \u201crobotic\u201d voices were much less effective. We decided to use the fantastic, Amazon Polly text to speech service, along with Alexa\u2019s own text to speech capabilities (probably the most realistic solution to date).\n\nIn addition to a set of high quality voices, we needed to come up with a workflow that lets users listen and make changes efficiently. Obviously, reading back an entire document with each little edit wasn\u2019t going to work so we developed an interface that lets users focus their read-back using simple text selection methods.\n\nTaken as a whole, Out Loud is an evolving, high quality, text to speech service combined with an interface that lets users efficiently select, listen, make changes, then listen again. Hopefully this combination improves your writing, its certainly improved ours, so please give us a try and let us know your experience.\n\n\nService Details:\nEnter your own words, phrases, sentences, poems, stories into our specially designed read-back text editor. When your masterpiece is ready tap the \u201cHere\u201d button or link with your Alexa device* - then, just sit back and listen away.\n\n\u2043 Startlingly realistic voice rendering improves the smoothness and clarity of your writing, helping you pick up on awkward changes in tempo and timing.\n- New Chrome Extension lets you read emails and other web based writing.\n\u2043 Reading along together with our service helps root out typos and other errors.\n\u2043 Designed to allow you to easily read back portions of longer documents. \n\u2043 Copy and paste entire text files or import/reload documents from Google Docs\u2122. \n\u2043 Select portions of your text, make edits, then read back any changes.\n\u2043 Make edits even if you don\u2019t have a connection to the internet. (Voice read back requires internet connection.)\n\n\nOut Loud Platform Details:\n - Mobile Device - using our Out Loud Companion app \n - Desktop & Laptop - using our Out Loud Chrome extension\n - Alexa Speaker - using our Out Loud Skill (linked below)\n\n\n------------------\nPlatform Links\n------------------\nChrome Extension\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/out-loud-extension/iniaggcnlkggcbbeikgkjffgcjpaeccg\n\nAlexa Skill\nhttps://www.amazon.com/TreesWithLeaves-LLC-Out-Loud/dp/B07RT3CCZK\n\niOS App\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/out-loud-companion/id1387883572\n\n\n------------------\nTerms & Policies\n------------------\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttps://www.treeswithleaves.com/olprivacypolicy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttps://www.treeswithleaves.com/oltermsofuse\n\n\n------------------\nEDUCATE FROM HOME OFFER\n------------------\nTo enable this offer please compete the following:\n1.
