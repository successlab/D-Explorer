Well, What Should I Weigh gives you the answer. It first calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) to determine in which of the 4 Weight Status Categories developed by the CDC you belong based on your weight in pounds and height in feet and inches. Then it uses your BMI to calculate your normal weight range and tells you the minimum number of pounds you need to gain or lose to get to normal. \n\nIt has a few other tools to help someone who is overweight or obese to create a weight loss plan. \n\nFirst, there is a tool that will give you 4 random activities with the length you must participate in them to burn the number of calories for the weight you specify. The information used to make these calculations was obtained from Ainsworth BE, Haskell WL, Herrmann SD, Meckes N, Bassett Jr DR, Tudor-Locke C, Greer JL, Vezina J, Whitt-Glover MC, Leon AS.
