I fell asleep in the middle of the city and woke up in the middle of the night, and the outside turned into a forest! It's raining outside. Close your eyes and listen quietly to the rain falling on the trees and leaves in the forest. I wanted to create a dreamy forest that wasn't bright or dark but not scary at the same time. You can see it somewhere, but I've painted a forest that you wouldn't see if you lived in a city.\n\n\nSteps for using the skill:\n\nSession 1:\nUser: Alexa, open sleeping rain\nAlexa: Starting sleeping rain You can say, start or begin, to begin.\nUser: start\nUser: begin\nAlexa: Rain on window thunder sounds\n<Alexa completes the story or user interruption>\nUser: Alexa, stop\nUser: Alexa, resume\nUser: Alexa, start over\nUser: Yes/No\n\n\nSession 2:\nUser: Alexa, open sleeping rain\nAlexa: <audio> You were listening to rain on window thunder sounds, Would you like to resume?\nUser: No\nAlexa: <Alexa starts over.
