Someone asks \"What game should we play?\" and is answered with \"I don't know.\", \"I don't care.\" and \"Just pick something.\" Now someone is faced with the stressful decision of choosing a game that will be fun, challenging, and most importantly one that everyone will enjoy. \n\nLater, if nobody enjoys the game or if the one selecting the game wins, then the person who made the choice will be judged (and maybe not invited to the next game nights).\n\nMeeple Buddy solves that problem by putting the burden of selecting a game on Alexa. Just tell Meeple Buddy about the games in your collection and then when game night comes along, simply ask Meeple Buddy to choose a game. Meeple Buddy can choose a game based on the number of players and the desired complexity of the game (or just any complexity if you don't care). \n\nNo more debating over what game to play and never again will you be the game night pariah from selecting the wrong game. Let Meeple Buddy handle the task while you focus on time with friends and family and, of course, winning.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
