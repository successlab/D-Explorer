Ex:\n\nWho is right, me or them/her/him?\n\nMighty Righty helps avoid arguing and confrontation by stating who is right, it doesn't mean you have to follow what Mighty Righty says, and of course this application is supposed to be just a joke, but a very helpful one as it comes from real life necessities. We know now who is right! Have fun!\nP.S. If you need instructions how to ask who is right, you can say: Help", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
