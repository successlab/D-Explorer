It is based on the life stories of Shirdi Sai Baba and his teachings. Many believe that Sai Baba himself wrote it! Many Sai devotees start the reading or listening of Sai Satcharitra from Thursday and try to complete all the chapters in 7 days. But, devotees can start and complete the chapters however they like. It is the firm faith & trust in Sai Baba which are necessary to experience Sai Leela's. Before listening to the Satcharitra chapters, we request Sai devotees to invoke Sai Baba mentally In front of them and pray to Sai Baba. While listening, you can say, Alexa Next or Previous to navigate through the chapters!
