The day has come when I had to stand up and fight off the excruciating pain I suffered from the reality that I had been discarded by everyone I had ever loved \u2013 friends, family, and people I had loved very deeply. I was alone in my darkness. There I was curled up on the shower floor, naked and crying, trying to seek relief from the swelling in my eyes. I had succumbed to affliction. \n\nAs I stepped up to the mirror to wipe the steam, it was strange how suddenly my own reflection caught my attention. I stopped for a moment and gazed deeply into my own eyes. As I gazed, I began to pierce my own soul \u2013 running flashbacks of every traumatic experience of my life. Just then, the defining moment in my life, I asked myself this critical question: \n\u201cIf you had never known what darkness or pain looks, feels, smells, tastes, and sounds like \u2013 how then, will you recognize peace and light?\u201d \u2013 Recognizing that I wouldn\u2019t change my own traumatic experiences shifted my view of myself from being a victim to being a survivor. I built Talk to Seanna after recognizing that had I not gone through my darkness, I wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge, skills, or ability to lead others into their light \u2013 and this is the purpose of my life. \n\nRecognizing that I wouldn\u2019t change my own traumatic experiences shifted my view of myself from being a victim to being a survivor.
