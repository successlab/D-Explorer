This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: audio player", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "This skill lets you play Jummah khutbah before Jummah prayer, which is a key component of Friday prayer. You may live in a place where there is no Mosque closer to you to attend Friday prayer or because of work commitment / less time you're not able to go to Mosque, this app will be perfect for you to listen to khutbah before performing Friday prayer. This idea came to my mind when I went with my other friends on holiday to Spain. We rented a villa in a remote area, there were only a few holiday homes nearby and the rest were mountains and fields. On Friday we were looking for Mosque but couldn't find any in that town so we decided to perform prayer at home. We asked everyone if someone can read khutbah but no one could do it. So we searched online and found one after looking at many videos and pdf documents. I thought why not create an app which allows someone in a similar situation would be able to play khutbah through the Alexa app with no or minimal effort. \n\nAll khutbahs are in the English language from different khateebs from different Mosques in the UK. Khutbahs are not specific to a certain maslik people but for everyone. I will try to replace the khutbah with a new one every 4 weeks insha'Allah. If you want me to upload Urdu khutbah too, please let me know in the comments.\n\nThe phrase you can say to invoke the skill once you have enabled the skill:\n# Alexa, open Audio Player (I tried to invoke the skill by saying Alexa open Jummah khutbah but Alexa was not able to understand the words so I changed it to Audio player).\n\nFeedback / Getting in touch with us:\nThis is the second app (1st one is \"Beautiful Azan\") I have created.
