He loves God. He loves his wife Rebecca and his 3 daughters. He loves people. He loves his job. He loves Texas BBQ. He loves an occasional round of golf. And he loves the Dallas Cowboys (but don\u2019t hold that against him!).\n\nRichard grew up as a missionary kid in Brazil, coming back to the states to \ufb01nish his education. He graduated from Baylor University in 1982 with a BA in Oral Communications, and earned his MDIV in 1985 from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, making him the sixth generation of pastors in his family. His early days of ministry included serving for three years as the Single Adults Pastor at the First Baptist Church of Dallas.\n\nThen in 1997, Richard Ellis founded Reunion Church, a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, non-denominational church in the heart of Dallas,Texas. Dallas needed a church like it. And it would need a pastor like Richard. So Reunion Church was born. And now the radio show and the website (www.RichardEllisTalks.com) join the Reunion Church community under the leadership of this guy. And we\u2019re all the better for it!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
