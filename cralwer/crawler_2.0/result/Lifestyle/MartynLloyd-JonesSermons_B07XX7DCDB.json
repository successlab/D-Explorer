Born in Wales, and educated in London, he was a brilliant student who embarked upon a short, but successful, career as a medical doctor at the famous St Bartholemew's Hospital. However, the call of Gospel ministry was so strong that he left medicine in order to become minister of a mission hall in Port Talbot, South Wales. Eventually he was called to Westminster Chapel in London, where thousands flocked to hear his \"full-blooded\" Gospel preaching, described by one hearer as \"logic on fire\". With some 1600 of his sermons recorded and digitally restored, this has left a legacy which is now available for the blessing of another generation of Christians around the world \u2014 \"Though being dead he still speaks\".\n\nOnce enabled, you can listen to the most recent episode by saying, \"Alexa, play MLJ Sermons.\"\n\nTo pause or resume any episode, say \"Alexa, pause\" or \"Alexa, resume.\" To listen to previous episodes, say \"Alexa, play the previous episode.\" If you want to know the title of an episode while the episode is playing, say \"Alexa, ask MLJ Sermons for the title of this episode.\" If you want to know the air date of an episode, say \"Alexa, ask MLJ Sermons for the date of this episode.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
