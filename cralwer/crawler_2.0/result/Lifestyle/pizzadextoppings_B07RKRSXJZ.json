As such, there are 2 main case uses of this skill; to get an \"amount\" of a topping that has to go on a sandwich or pizza or, to show a recipe aid. Asking for an amount on a sandwich/pizza item will also display its respective recipe aid/image.\n\nThe user must input a \"topping type\", a \"size\" and a \"portion\" and will be given an amount.\nFor example \"How much pepperoni on a large 2 topping\" indicates that the user would like to know how much of the pepperoni topping needs to be put on a pizza. This pizza is of size \"large\" and it is layered with two sets of the same topping.\nGiven that the response, the amount of this \"pepperoni\" topping is measured in ounces, or an amount specific to the chefs, it will respond with something like \"40\" or \"5 ounces\".\n\nIf the device the user is using for this skill supports a display, they will also be able to see an accompanying graphic.\nIf the user would like, they could also ask directly for an aid, such as \"Show job aid for buffalo chicken.\" This will prompt the skill to show the corresponding aid that houses a pizza type called \"buffalo chicken'. This section is only available in display on rectangular screens, henceforth the small round hub will only display the device's logo.\n\nTo see what options are available (toppings, sizes and portions), assuming that the device has a rectangular display, the user may use touch navigation to navigate though the different aid buttons to get sense as to what they can ask for.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
