Let's make life a little easier for everyone.\n\nUsing GG Care (formerly GranGran), carers can use our web platform to set up helpful reminders, which we call voice tasks. Delivered on an Alexa device, these voice tasks can help loved ones remember to call relatives, take a stretch with chair exercises, or even make some tea. Keep up the well being of your \"care resident\" on the GG Care dashboard.\n\nWhen a voice task is scheduled, the GG Care skill will gently guide the \"Care Resident\" with a series of questions and prompts. If the care resident needs additional assistance completing a task, Alexa can provide helpful hints. The carer can check the GG Care dashboard to see which tasks have been completed.
