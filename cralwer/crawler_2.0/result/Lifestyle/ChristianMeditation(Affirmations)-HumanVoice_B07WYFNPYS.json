By popular demand, we have released a human voice version of our Who I Am In Christ (Biblical Affirmations) Alexa skill. \n\nEnable this skill to hear what the Bible says about Christians. Ask Alexa, open voice voice bible affirmations and \"who am I\", \"tell me truth\", \"what does the bible say\", or \"what does Jesus say\".\n\nThis Christian Mediation (Who I Am) skill is short and simple on purpose. When you open it, one affirmation from scripture will be spoken several times. This is intended to offer quick reminders as you scurry about your day and home.\n\nIn our modern world, everyone and everything tries to define you and tell you what and who you are or are not. This simple skill helps Christians focus on what the Bible and Jesus Christ say about who they are as they seek to love, worship, and obey Jesus.\n\nImportant: We are considering offering this as a paid skill for $1.99/mo. This would allow us to invest more time in growing the the skills and library. However, we wanted to offer this for free to start.
