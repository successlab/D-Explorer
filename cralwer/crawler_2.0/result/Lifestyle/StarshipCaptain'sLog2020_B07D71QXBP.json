This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: captains log", "reviewnum": " 18", "des": "Starship Captains Log 2020 enables you to record, load, delete and find entries from your own captain's log. The optional subscription feature allows you to have all log entries saved to your own private, personal Google sheet on your Google drive. Entries from ALL free users are stored in a single, PUBLIC log, so be careful what you choose to say. Free log entries are cleared at the end of each month. \n\nAccount linking is required to make purchases with this skill. Please use your Alexa app or use your browser to access https://alexa.amazon.com/ to enable this skill and link your Amazon account. \n\nOnce enabled, invoke this skill by saying OPEN CAPTAINS LOG. (All methods of invocation route you through the initialization sequence, so it is easiest to just say OPEN CAPTAINS LOG). \n\nThe commands for using this skill include, GET COMMANDS, NEW ENTRY, LOAD, FIND, READ, FIRST, PREVIOUS, NEXT, LAST, DELETE, REPEAT, HELP and END. \n\nThis skill records your new log entries in a series of segments. Each time you pause, this skill will save the entry segments and notify you with a sci-fi tone. After the tone, you can then add another segment to your entry. Each beep IS NOT a new log. I repeat, when it beeps, it is THE SAME LOG ENTRY. The beep indicates a new sub entry has been created within the same log. Think of them as sentences. To create a new log entry, say NEW. While in most cases you can simply state your log entry, Alexa does have some reserved words, if the skill doesn't react the way it should, simply say a different starting word followed by the new sub log entry. \n\nTo hear your full log entry, say READ. \n\nTo delete a segment, use the FIRST, PREVIOUS, NEXT, and LAST commands to navigate to the segment. To replay a subentry say REPEAT. If you want to delete the subentry say DELETE. \n\nWhen doing a FIND <word or phrase> or LOAD <ACTUAL DATE (not star date)> (the load option include ALL ENTRIES, or date, or year and month, or just the year ) the entries returned can be navigated using the same FIRST, NEXT, PREVIOUS and LAST commands. To replay an entry say REPEAT. To delete the current entry, say DELETE. To return and continue your current log entry, simply say RESUME.\n\nContextual HELP is available at any time. \n\nTo repeat the last response from Alexa say REPEAT.\n\nNote: a special thank you to our users. We have incorporated your feedback to make this the best version yet. Previous users can email the Wish and a Prayer Studio team at waapsdev@gmail.com to have their old entries sent to them via email.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
