We are a place for storytelling content and a place for story-building community. Our journey started many years ago on another blogging network and continues here today with a blog, podcast, YouTube channel, and thriving Patreon brotherhood. We follow Jesus with the conviction of living out this life under a traditional sexual ethic. We never chose our story, but we believe we\u2019ve been chosen for one another in this story. So pull up a chair, or grab a walking stick and a pen; we hope you'll journey with us!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
