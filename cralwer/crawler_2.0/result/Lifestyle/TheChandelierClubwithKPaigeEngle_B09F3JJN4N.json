You can just say \"Alexa, open The Chandelier Club with K Paige Engle.\". You can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit anytime.\nDo you want to know how to live your best life as a Woman in the Middle? This skill supports women 40-65 years old with being more visible online and off. The Chandelier Club is a monthly membership community to help women become more visible for their businesses, projects and their lives. So often women in our age group lose track of who we are while serving everyone else and then it can seem quite overwhelming to step back up to the plate again. So I wanted to create a community & platform so that women don't have to learn all the things on their own but be able to have the \"how to\" resources at their fingertips when they need them to build authority and their personal brands.\n\nThis skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
