If girls can create a habit of stepping up and speaking up, that habit will soon become routine and when it becomes routine we WILL change the world. \n\nWhen girls share their fears, failures, successes, ideas and opinions with other girls through stories they create connections. It\u2019s through those connections that we inspire other girls to share their own stories. We envision a global network of girl thought leaders, supporting each other, by fearlessly using their own voices to positively impact our world. \n\nJoin us and fearlessly use your voice by submitting your story to info@SheRocksTheWorld.org \n\nStart your day with, \"Alexa, open She Rocks The World\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
