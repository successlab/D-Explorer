By enabling this skill, you will be able to hear prayers and services from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer from the comfort of your own home. Simply launch the skill by saying \u201cAlexa, open the Cambridge Prayer Book\u201d.\n\nOnce inside, you can take part in the full Morning or Evening Prayer services, or even components of these services such as the Lord\u2019s Prayer. You can also hear more about the Book of Common Prayer and its creator, Thomas Cranmer, or information about Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Bibles.\n\nThe 1662 Book of Common Prayer (also known as the \u2018BCP\u2019 or \u2018Prayer Book\u2019) remains an official liturgy of the Church of England to this day. Its words and phrases have made a major contribution to the English language and remain central to Anglican worship. We hope that, by providing this skill, you can enjoy the beautiful language of the BCP and perform your devotions whenever you like and from wherever you are.\n\nReverend James Shakespeare and Reverend Chris Campbell from St John the Evangelist Church Cambridge, will each lead the services. You can also choose to read along with the voices of the Press choir for the congregational responses, as if you are part of a church congregation. To skip through the Morning and Evening Prayer services, say \u201cnext\u201d at the end of each 4 minute segment. You can choose to skip a segment or start from where you left off by saying, for instance, \u201cAlexa, give me part 3 of Morning Prayer\u201d. The services are supported with 14 Bible readings, two for each day of the week. The Bible readings will alternate, as will the officiant.\n\nWhy not explore this skill further with the following commands and examples:\n- Say Morning Prayer\n- Say Evening Prayer\n- Give me the Apostles\u2019 Creed\n- Recite the Grace\n- Tell me more about the 1662 BCP\n- I\u2019d like to learn about Thomas Cranmer\n- What is Cambridge Bibles?\n- How old is Cambridge University Press? \n\nTo find out more, please visit www.cambridge.org/bibles.\n\nFor suggestions and feedback, please leave us a message at alexa.support@cambridge.org.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
