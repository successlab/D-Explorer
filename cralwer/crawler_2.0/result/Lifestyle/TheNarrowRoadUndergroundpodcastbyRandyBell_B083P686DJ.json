You will hear that Jesus is the only way to heaven. Also, to follow Jesus in America today you must live a counter-cultural life that crashes against the norms of society. American culture resists and contradicts the teachings and commands of Jesus. That is why the way of the Kingdom of Heaven is a narrow way that only a few will find and follow.\n\nYou can pause and play by saying \"Alexa, pause\" and \"Alexa, resume.\" Just say \"Alexa, stop\" when you're done for the day. When listening to podcasts you can say \"Alexa, shuffle\" to shuffle the playing order, or \"Alexa, loop\" to loop the current episode. You can also ask for previous and next episodes by saying \"Alexa, previous\" and \"Alexa, next\".", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
