Seniors and others can use VoiceR whether or not a caregiver or family member is available.\n \nVoiceR includes a \u201ccall for help\u201d (SOS) function whereby the user or caregiver can have a list of caregivers or medical personnel set up in a \u201cnotify\u201d group that will be notified if the user asks for help. Optionally a call center number may also be included in this list.\n\n The standalone no-charge VoiceR app provides a senior or other user with verbal reminders, appointments, news and weather, quizzes (to hone mental skills) and daily voice memos. Both the senior and the person receiving the message must have (and use) the free Alexa app.\n \nTo use VoiceR, do the following:\n \n\u00b7 Create an Amazon account if you don\u2019t already have one (www.amazon.com)\n\u00b7 Download the Alexa app (www.amazon.com/alexa)\n\u00b7 Install the Echo Dot.
