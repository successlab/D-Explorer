My rest days are Tuesday and Friday but whatever works for you is the best. It is best to set a time for every workout as it helps keep you motivated. In my opinion, it is best to do it early in the morning because most of us usually feel sluggish or not really motivated to work out in the afternoon. Remember to warm up before exercising by stretching and keep in mind a good diet is key to a healthier life! Good luck and try your best!", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
