My focus is on integrative and functional medicine, and I try to put the 'fun' in functional medicine whenever I can. My philosophy is to look for the root cause of illness and guide you to lifestyle and nutritional interventions whenever possible, to get you off and keep you off long term prescription medications. I am on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Organic and Natural Health Association, and am an Advisor to the Board of Directors for ACAM-The American College for the Advancement in Medicine. At ACAM, I help create yearly symposiums that have educated thousands of integrative doctors all over the world. I have published my first book called \"Quench\" on the new science of hydration from Hachette Book Group in 2018. It was featured in the New York Times and O Magazine and has been translated into 6 languages.\"\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
