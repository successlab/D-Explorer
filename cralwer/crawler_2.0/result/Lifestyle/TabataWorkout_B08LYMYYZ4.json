This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: tabata workout\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "Tabata is a form of HIIT or High-Intensity Interval Training that consists of 8 rounds of 20 seconds each of maximum effort exercise, each round is followed by 10 seconds of rest. The entire workout lasts 240 seconds or 4 minutes in total. \n\nThis skill builds a unique workout track every time it runs. It utilizes the new Alexa Presentation Language for Audio to produce a new track that mixes an upbeat track for the active seconds, a slower track for the rest minutes and generates the speech that goes with both types of tracks. The end result, no two tracks are the same. \n\nThe COVID-19 physical distancing and stay-at-home orders have changed our daily lives. Working from home, or rather, \"homing\" from work, gives us little to no opportunity to get enough exercise. Hence, this skill will help you get a great High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in 4 minutes only. \n\nWhy Tabata?\n\n- Tabata is a great workout for fat burning. Additionally, the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption keeps you burning calories for hours. \n- It's short; it takes only 4 minutes to complete.\n- Increases endurance. \n\nEnjoy the music and if you have a royalty-free track that is a good fit for this skill, please let us know and we would be more than happy to add it to our library; info@cloudpixel.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
