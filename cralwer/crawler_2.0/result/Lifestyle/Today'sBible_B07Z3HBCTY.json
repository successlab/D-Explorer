Just sit back and listen. Alexa brings the Bible alive. \n\n Today's Bible was written in today's words with the help of today's advanced tools to produce a high definition Bible that is much more accurate to the original Greek text and easy-to-understand. \n\n Even if you never go to church, you won't have a problem understanding this Bible.\n\n Start with John 1 (just say, \"Start\" after Today's Bible starts). When Alexa is finished with it, say Next, and she will go to the next chapter. You can go all the way through the New Testament like this. \n\n Today's Bible also features a daily chapter from the Bible (just say Daily).\n\n The text for Today's Bible is from the Breakthrough Version (BV) - the High Definition Bible. It is more accurate to the Greek text than the old Bibles yet it is in today's words.\n\n Discover God's message and instruction for you from the comfort of your home.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
