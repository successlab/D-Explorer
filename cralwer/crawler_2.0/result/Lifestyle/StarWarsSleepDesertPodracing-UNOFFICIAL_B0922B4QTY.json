Each sound is a full hour of mono-channel audio. They do not support a looping function, but they loop indefinitely every hour. If you have ideas for other Star Wars sleep sounds, please contact us at admin@iksterog.com and let us know! We have some ideas in mind already, such as the amphibious wildlife of Dehgobah, the gentle hum of a light speed warp drive, and the soothing gasses of the volcanic planet, Mustafar.\n\nTo support our other apps and projects, app support, or to stay up to date with our goings on, check out our social media.
