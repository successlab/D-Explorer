This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: prayer time", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "There are multiple prayer time skills out there but what distinguishes this skill from the rest is that it can calculate prayer times for both Sunni and Shia Muslims successfully. It is also possible to get when a prayer time ends. Last but not least this skill works in all locations, not just in North America\n\nTo start using the skill just setup the desired prayer calculation by saying one of the following:\n- Alexa set calculation method to Jafari\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to One\n- Alexa set calculation method to Tehran\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Two\n- Alexa set calculation method to Mwl\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Three\n- Alexa set calculation method to Isna\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Four\n- Alexa set calculation method to Egypt\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Five\n- Alexa set calculation method to Makkah\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Six\n- Alexa set calculation method to Karachi\n * Or say: Alexa set calculation method to Seven\n\nTo get next prayer time just say:\n- Alexa open prayer time\n\nIt is possible to get the prayer time for a specific prayer, not just the next prayer time:\n- Alexa ask prayer time for PRAYER_TYPE prayer:\n * For example: Alexa ask prayer time for maghrib prayer \n- Since Alexa cannot understand all prayer types well, especially \"Dohor\" prayer, due to the language barrier, it is possible to ask Alexa for all the prayer types:\n * Alexa ask prayer time for All prayer types\n\nTo get the end of a prayer time just say:\n- Alexa ask prayer time for end time\n\nThis skill asks for the user's location to calculate the appropriate prayer times. However, it is also possible to manually input the location to be used. Only the city and country are of importance. To do so just say:\n- Alexa ask prayer time to set city to YOUR_CITY_NAME and country to YOUR_COUNTRY_NAME\n * For example: Alexa ask prayer time to set city to Los Angeles and country to USA\n\nAnd if for any reason in the future you want alexa to get your location automatically just remove the manually inputted city:\n- Alexa ask prayer time to delete my saved location\n\nTo check what city is being used in the prayer time calculation just say:\n- Alexa ask prayer time for my current city\n\nIf for any reason this skill does not behave as expected or you wish for any additional functionality to make your life a bit simpler please email me at: mhammoud@hotmail.ca", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
