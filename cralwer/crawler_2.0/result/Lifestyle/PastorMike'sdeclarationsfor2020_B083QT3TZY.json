Knowing how busy everyone's lives are; I knew that would be a challenge for myself as well as others. In setting up our second Alexa for the upstairs, I thought, \"I have Alexa set to give me the news, read my emails, recite my schedule and order my Starbucks in the morning....why not declare over my life the words I need to hear most every morning?\" Knowing many members use their Alexas for similar things...i felt it necessary to create this skill with Pastor Mike's declarations as a skill. Easy to open once you've activated the skill. Just say, \"Alexa open My Declarations\". May this words attach themselves to your mind and heart and manifest quickly in your lives as your reality as you hear them the next 365 days. Be blessed.", "priv": ""}
