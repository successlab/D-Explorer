All you have to do is tell me to start and stop feedings. To start a new feeding session, you can say 'Alexa, start a left feeding session'. To stop a feeding, say 'Alexa, stop feeding'. This will just pause the timer for the feeding session. Once you have started a feeding session, you can say 'Alexa, start right feeding' to switch to the right side. You can save a feeding session by saying 'Alexa, save feeding session'. The saved feeding session will have the start time, total duration, and end time.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
