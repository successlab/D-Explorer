Find out what you appreciate about each other, or what you learned today, or what you're proud of. This skill takes away the pressure of coming up with a prompt and deciding who to share it with. Ask Alexa for a family share prompt, and she'll read a randomly-selected response, while also telling you who to share it with. You can ask for a family share prompt as often as you'd like.
