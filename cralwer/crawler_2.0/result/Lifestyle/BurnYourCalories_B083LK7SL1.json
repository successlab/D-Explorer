Our foods are labeled with the calories they contain, but few of us have any knowledge of how many calories are used to walk or run 2 miles. We all know that to lose weight you need to burn more calories than you eat. But most of us don\u2019t know how long it takes to burn 500 extra calories. Have you ever wondered how you can burn those extra calories from that second helping of dessert you had? Burn Your Calories can help answer that question for you. \n\nAfter opening Burn Your Calories, you just have to say, \u201cHow can I burn 300 calories?\u201d and you\u2019ll be asked your weight. With that information, it will calculate approximately how many minutes you must perform each of 4 random activities. Over 80 activities are used including ones in sports, running, biking, dancing, playing musical instruments, and doing household chores. \n\nThe results calculated are approximations that will give you an idea of how long you will need to perform a specific activity to burn up the number of calories you specify. An interesting point to note is that the more a person weighs, the more calories they will burn doing a given activity for a specific amount of time. This means that as you lose weight, you will have to exercise longer to lose the same amount of weight you lost when you weighed more.\n\nThe information used to make these calculations was obtained from Ainsworth BE, Haskell WL, Herrmann SD, Meckes N, Bassett Jr DR, Tudor-Locke C, Greer JL, Vezina J, Whitt-Glover MC, Leon AS.
