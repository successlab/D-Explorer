They combine low air consumption with high nitrogen capacity. The benefits for you: you need a small compressor, only a few modules, and operational costs are low.\n\nSEPURAN\u00ae N2 is especially suitable in a wide variety of blanketing or inerting. As opposed to other membrane modules that are available on the market, the Evonik module combines excellent capacity with low air consumption. Alternatively, our SEPURAN\u00ae N2 Selective module can be used for low throughput volumes. The Selective version achieves high purity with extremely low air consumption. Energy consumption is especially low, while the capacity remains competitive.\n\nEFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC\nEnormous cost savings compared to conventional gas cylinders.\nLow installation and running costs.\nLow maintenance.\nLATEST TECHNOLOGY\nHigh capacity combined with low air consumption.\nPurity of up to 99.5% N2.\nPressure up to 16 barg.\nSIMPLE AND SAFE\nFlexible in terms of adjusting purity.\nEasy to operate and install.\nNo safety risks associated with handling gas cylinders.\nUse Evonik\u2019s SEPURAN\u00ae N2 calculator to learn how much nitrogen you can make. Estimate the number and type of membranes you need by defining the nitrogen flow, temperature, nitrogen purity and pressure.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
