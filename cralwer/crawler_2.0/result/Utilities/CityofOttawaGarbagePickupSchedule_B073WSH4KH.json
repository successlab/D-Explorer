This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: ottawa garbage", "reviewnum": " 5", "des": "UPDATED for English-Canada as of January 26th, 2018! This skill was originally developed for English-US before Alexa was available in Canada and it had problems for people that were using English-Canada as their language. It now works for everyone. Huzah!\n\nYou can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.\n\nPlease make sure to prefix your question with \"Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage\". You can also say \"Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage\" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date. You can't just say \"Alexa, when is garbage day\". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.\n\nIf you're address isn't recognized, hit me up on twitter @stevemulligan or email steve@nonlocal.ca and I will do my best to get the skill working properly for you.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
