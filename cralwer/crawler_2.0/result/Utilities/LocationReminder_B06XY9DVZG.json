You can tell it where your stuff is and after you inevitably forget it, you can just ask Alexa. Unfortunately this is setup for a pretty strict input structure. For making an entry say something like \"My/The/... stuff is/are in/at/under/... location\", and for getting reminded the command structure is \"where is/are my/the/... stuff\". You can also delete entries. I hope this skill helps somebody.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
