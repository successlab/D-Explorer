A common problem known in computer engineering is the Year 2038 problem. This problem describes how the Internet's \"time\" will be reset to January 1, 1970 - 12 AM due to the binary encoding of 32-bit integers. This special date is \"when\" the internet started.\n\nA lot of other computer systems build off this very fundamental date and time, but since this was implemented so long ago, an update would be required for nearly every computer system on the planet to continue working. This app tells you how much longer we have until the Internet (and pretty much any electronic device) stops working!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
