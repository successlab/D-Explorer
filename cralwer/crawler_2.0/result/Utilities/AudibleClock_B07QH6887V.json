This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: audible clock\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 139", "des": "Turn your Alexa into any one of a variety of audible clocks, such as a grandfather clock, cuckoo clock, talking clock, and more! It's a fun, useful, and entertaining way to track the time.\n\nSee www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any problems, feedback, questions, or suggestions.\n \nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThis skill works like a long playlist so you can easily -- even accidentally -- stop it by asking Alexa to \"stop.\" In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song, playlist, or podcast, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play your most recent request instead. (Amazon does not allow us to interrupt these other audio streams with clock chimes.) Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say \"Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock\" (or another clock of your choice).\n \nWhen launched via a Routine, Audible Clock automatically starts your last-played clock. So, once you've launched your favorite clock, you can restart it at any time (every morning, if you like) using an Alexa Routine. \n \nFUN TIP\nMany people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as an audible clock. Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.\n \nCLOCK SHOP\nWant a clock that meows like a cat? We've got that. How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a Ship's Bell, or even Stephen Hawking? We've got those too. We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.\n \nFor a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say \"Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.\" We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.\n \nPREMIUM CLOCKS\nIn addition to its many free clocks (\"Alexa, ask Audible Clock for free clocks\"), Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can try out with an All Access Pass. These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat \"meow\" the Westminster Chimes?).\n \nSUPPORT\nProblems or questions? Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill. We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.\n \nAnother timeless skill from www.thomptronics.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
