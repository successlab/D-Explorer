They're like a 'do not disturb' sign or sticky note that automatically expires. Set a busy timer just before joining a meeting or when you are on the go and want family members to know where you are.\n\nA busy timer is made of 3 parts: a name, a duration and an optional icon. The duration must be between 1 minute and 24 hours. The name can be the first name of a person, the name of a room, or a custom name like Mom or Dad. There are over 50 emoji to choose from and includes telephone, eating, and exercising. A Busy Timer is used to let others know that someone or someplace is busy, for how long, and an optional icon to give more info. Add a timer, and others on your account when they launch the skill will get a list of the active busy timers. There is no notification that a timer has expired.\n\nUsing the Busy Timers widget, see the list of active timers. Tap a timer to extend the time or delete it. Look for the Busy Timers widget in the Widget Gallery on supported Echo Show devices.\n\nThis skill works best when used on an Echo Show device but also works on devices without a screen.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
