Cactus carer tells you when you will need to water or feed you cacti. You can add as many cacti as you want by saying \"Alexa, tell cactus carer I have a cactus called {name}\".\n\nOnce you have your cacti added all you need to do is say \"Alexa, ask cactus carer what do my cacti need today?\". You will then be told if you need to water or feed any of your cacti. \n\nAlso, because cacti have a growing season which differs depending on which hemisphere you live in, if you don't live in the northern hemisphere which it defaults to, you can say \"Alexa, tell cactus carer I live in the southern hemisphere\".\n\nFor a full list of available phrases go to https://cactus-carer.codingcactus.repl.co/#phrases-page", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
