It is free software and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.\n\nExisting machine translation systems available at present are mostly commercial or use proprietary technologies, which makes them very hard to adapt to new usages. Apertium uses a language-independent specification, to allow for the ease of contributing to Apertium, more efficient development, and enhancing the project's overall growth.\n\nAt present, Apertium has released 40 stable language pairs, delivering fast translation with reasonably intelligible results (errors are easily corrected). Being an open-source project, Apertium provides tools for potential developers to build their own language pair and contribute to the project.\n\nThis skill uses Apertium-Apy, the API of Apertium to provide the users translations that are currently available in production phase of Apertium. You can also use this skill to learn all the translations that are offered by Apertium. This skill also helps in identifying the language spoken by the user. Though, document and website translation are also some of the primary features of Apertium, they are currently under development in this skill and are going to be live soon.\n\nHere are some of the commands to help you get started:\n\n1) \"Alexa open Smart Apertium\"\n \"Welcome to the Smart Apertium Translator. You can ask me to translate a sentence, translate a document or identify the language of speech. You can also know what type of language translations are currently available in the skill. So what do you want to do for now?\"\n\n2) \"Alexa ask Smart Apertium how do you say happy birthday in Spanish\"\n \"Cumplea\u00f1os feliz\"\n\n3) \"Alexa ask Smart Apertium how do you say eu vou correr in Spanish language\"\n \"YO voy a correr\"\n\n4) \"Alexa ask Smart Apertium can you translate English\"\n \"English language can be translated from Catalan, Welsh, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Basque, Icelandic, Esperanto, Galician, Spanish languages and translated to Galician, Spanish, Esperanto, Catalan languages.\"\n\n5) \"Alexa ask Smart Apertium hola amigos is in which language\"\n \"The phrase spoken is in Spanish language.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
