It provides an another opportunity to practice listening skills. \nDetails of development: I used the new beta AWS Developer Console function that develops your code inline which makes creating a new skill a no brainer and very fast. Could have done it in a couple hours had I known the syntax of subscript and how to create acceptable mp3 files for S3. As it was it took about a day to get everything done.\nFound out that the mp3 file format must be 16000 and 48k or it won't work. \nFinally, it would be nice to get the user's local time and there is an API for that but unfortunately the API returns a text version of the users timezone (Like Africa) so you would need a database to look up the time offset from UTC. Too much work so this little skill just returns UTC. I know that I live in a timezone that is 8 hours ahead of UTC.\nAnyway, it was a good exercise and it is nice to know it is so easy to make a skill now compared to earlier versions of AWS Skill Kit.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
