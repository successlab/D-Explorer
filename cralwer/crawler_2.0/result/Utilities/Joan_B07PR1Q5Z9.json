They can use Alexa to find an available room, find out if the room is free, and book the room. If they are in a reserved room, Alexa can also provide employees with information on who reserved the room and for how long. To get started, create an AWS account and access Alexa for Business. Next, enable the skill in the Alexa for Business console, link your Joan account, and add this skill to a skill group to enable it for your rooms.
