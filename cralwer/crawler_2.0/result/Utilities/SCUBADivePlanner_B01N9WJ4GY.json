This skill follows the philosophy that there is no such thing as a \u201cno decompression dive\u201d. No matter how shallow the depth or short the bottom time, by diving you will incur the poorly understood consequences of breathing mixed gasses at an atmospheric pressure well beyond our normal operating range. Care should be taken to carefully control the ascent rate and follow a decompression stop protocol for all dives, even those within recreational no-stop limits, to minimize the stresses on our bodies.", "priv": ""}
