This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: habit tracker", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Track your habits by voice! Scientists say it takes about 66 days to form a new habit. I've developed a habit tracker that you can interact with using your voice, and Alexa can encourage you along the way!\n\nThis is a skill I developed as a pet project after the Alexa Health and Wellness team was dissolved by the larger Alexa re-structure. It's not intended to be monetized or used for advertisement, simply a great way to practice and apply what I learned through Amazon and to demonstrate my capability to develop and deliver intuitive Software experiences.\n\nThere's a few limitations that you should keep in mind:\n\n- Only supports simple habits that start with a verb, ex: Swim 10 Laps, Run a Mile, etc...\n- Track up to 3 habits at a time max\n- Only tracks up to 66 days at a time\n- If a day is missed, no capability to go back and correct it after the day is over\n- No ability to rename habits at the moment without deleting the streak data\n\nCheck out my portfolio at https://stewart-m-holloway.github.io/ !
