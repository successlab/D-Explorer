As with all things Zen, quotes aren't about beliefs or ideas, but universal wisdom which you will discover in your own daily life. \nReflective quotes is just one way to these universal truths, countless mystics and spiritual traditions. Zen is about pointing to the universal everyday wisdom all around you, about getting you to experience things purely \"as they are\", not about convincing you of some specific way of thinking, or about stamping some specific label on something. Don't get caught up in thinking something is \"Zen\" or anything like that, these are simply bits of wisdom pointing to universal truth. Treat them as such and let them guide you towards a life of greater peace and joy.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
