Once the deadline(s) is/are added, you can ask Alexa to get a due date for a particular deadline by just saying the name of the deadline. You can also ask Alexa to tell you all your upcoming deadlines and Alexa will list out all the deadlines you have along with the date they each of them is due on. The skill also allows you to delete a particular deadline that you no longer want by just saying its name or it also allows you to delete all of your previously added deadlines (The skill can remove your previous 25 deadlines at a time. To delete more, you can just ask Alexa to delete your deadlines again and it will delete the next 25 deadlines). \n\nThis skill allows you to easily add, get or delete all your upcoming deadlines and their due dates without the need to use a reminder, an alarm or a notebook to save it or write it down somewhere.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
