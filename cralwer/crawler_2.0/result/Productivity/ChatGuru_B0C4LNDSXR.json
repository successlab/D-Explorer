This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: chat guru", "reviewnum": " 3", "des": "Chat Guru brings you the power of OpenAI's amazing ChatGPT through any Alexa device.\n\nAsk a question and it will respond and continue to have a conversation with you just like a real person. The conversation can flow naturally because it will remember what you said previously. For example:\n\nUser: \"Who won the Super Bowl in 1989?\"\nChat Guru: \"The Super Bowl in 1989 was Super Bowl XXIII, and it was won by the San Francisco 49ers.\"\nUser: \"Who was the MVP?\"\nChat Guru: \"The Most Valuable Player (MVP) of Super Bowl XXIII in 1989 was Jerry Rice.\"\n\nSome examples of things Chat Guru can help you with are:\n\n- Find a recipe for dinner based on ingredients you have on hand.\n- Create a new song or poem about a particular topic.\n- Write a draft of a tweet, email or other writing given a subject. \n- Translate any phrase to dozens of different languages and you will get back a high quality translation.\n- Answer any question that comes to mind that Alexa can't answer on its own.\n\nSay 'list modes' to hear Chat Guru's different response modes like pirate mode or sarcastic mode.\n\nNote that for now Chat Guru has limited knowledge about any current events past 2021, so it can't answer questions about the weather, recent movies, or predict the future.\n\nChat Guru is more creative than precise, so please double check any responses, and don't rely on its factual answers for anything important.\n\nSpeaking to Chat Guru consumes tokens for every word spoken. You are given tokens for free to start and can purchase more as needed. Note that the longer a conversation is, the more tokens it will consume.\n\nWhether you need a virtual assistant, a conversational partner, or a quick source of information, Chat Guru is the perfect addition to your Alexa-powered device.\n\n-----\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nYou must be at least 13 years old to use Chat Guru.
