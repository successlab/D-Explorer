Each measurement is organized by subject (whatever it is you're measuring) and dimensions. For example, when measuring a door, provide width and height as follows:\n\nU: \"Alexa, ask Measure Up to measure something.\"\nA: \"What are you measuring?\"\nU: \"My front door.\"\nA: \"What is the dimension for the measurement?\"\nU: \"Width.\"\nA: \"Using a number and units, what is the measurement for this dimension?\"\nU: \"Seventy inches\"\nA: \"Got it. What is the next dimension for this measurement?\"\nU: \"Height.\"\nA: \"Using a number and units, what is the measurement?\"\n...and so forth.\n\nIn this way very elaborate measurements may be stored for easy review and recall. We can also convert any compatible dimensions on demand when you retrieve your measurement. Here is another example:\n\nU: \"Alexa, ask Measure Up to get a measurement.\"\nA: \"Regarding what?\"\nU: \"My front door.\"\nA: \"The measure for width is seventy inches.\"\nU: \"Convert to centimeters.\"\nA: \"The measure for width is 177.8 centimeters.\"\nU: \"Next.\"\nA: \"The measure for height is 213.36 centimeters.\"\n...and so on.\n\nMeasure Up can handle simple fractional amounts and makes a best effort attempt at conversions. \nStay tuned, there's more to come!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
