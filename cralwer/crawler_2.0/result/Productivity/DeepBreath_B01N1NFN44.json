Are you wanting to refocus your energy? Then just ask Alexa!\n\n\u201cDeep Breath\u201d was created to help walk people through deep, diaphragmatic breathing exercises that are subtly coupled with imagery and grounding scenarios. Psychologists suggest that by just taking one moment out of your day to breathe, there are tremendous psychosocial and physiological benefits! Alexa will take you through, step-by-step, a short breathing exercise that promotes breathing and imagery for stress reduction. This is a universal script that can be used intentionally, where you are taking time out of your day to close your eyes and breathe, or on-the-go, with your eyes open and not necessarily in a \u201czen\u201d environment. Whether you\u2019re at the office and it\u2019s particularly stressful, or even if you\u2019re trying to help someone else de-stress, this Skill will be perfectly suited.\n\nThis Alexa Skill was designed for everyone. Anyone can use it, at any time, and in any place (that is wi-fi enabled, of course)!\n\nReady for a break? It\u2019s as easy as \u201cDeep Breath\u201d.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
