Use space or blank for missing letters and use numbers one and two for known duplicate letters, e.g. you can say: My letters are h e one one space.\nYou can use letters (a, b, c etc), or the phonetic alphabet (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc).\nA small dictionary of around 74,000 words is initially used, but you can also use a much larger one, which includes slang words. The skill will also tell you which words have non-duplicated letters, which is helpful for some word puzzles.\nThe above request finds three words in the small dictionary (hello , hells , henna), but finds two more in the large dictionary (helly and henry). Both UK and US words are in the dictionary.\nThe trial version enables you to find four and five letter words. Purchasing the upgrade provides access to all words greater than three letters.\n\nSay \"Open word search\" to start the skill. Then say \"My letters are\", and provide some letters as shown above. Alternatively, do it all in one go, for instance say: \"Ask word search for the letters g one one d space y blank\".\n\nYou can ask for the found words to be repeated (say repeat) or say help for extra information.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
