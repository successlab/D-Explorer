For a full list of features, please see the skill's Privacy Policy link below. ---\n\nDisclaimer: Linking your Todoist account and purchasing the skill are required for operation (see below).\n\nEffortlessly add tasks to your Todoist Inbox using just your voice through Alexa! Quick Add for Todoist utilizes Todoist\u2019s natural language processing to allow you to add tasks effortlessly. Simply say, 'Alexa, tell Quick Add to add [task],' and it will be added to your Todoist Inbox with a default due date of today. For tasks needing a specific due date, just include it after the task name. To omit a due date, say \"no date\" after the task name.\n\nCustom Projects: Have a custom Todoist project you'd like to add a task to rather than the default Inbox? After your task name, say \"[to my/on my] [custom Todoist project name].\" For example, \"Alexa, tell Quick Add to put apples on my Grocery List.\" Whichever custom project you choose in Todoist, its name MUST either be one word or contain no spaces. So, for example, if you have a project named \"Grocery List\" in Todoist, you would need to edit the name to \"GroceryList\" (no spaces) for this feature to work.\n\nManage your to-do list hands-free while focusing on your productivity, not your planning. Just say the task and, optionally, when it\u2019s due, and Alexa handles the rest. Perfect for busy individuals who need to organize their tasks quickly and efficiently!\n\nTo purchase the skill, after enabling it and successful Todoist account linking in a browser SAY, \"Alexa, open Quick Add.\"\n\nFor Android users authenticating with Todoist: Android has a feature that opens app links in the native app. However, account linking NEEDS to happen in the browser and not in the native Todoist app. The easiest way to do this is by temporarily turning off the \"Open By Default\" setting found at Settings/Apps/Todoist/Open By Default. Otherwise, you may complete the linking process directly from a web browser instead or copy the URL from the app and paste it into your browser's address bar.\n\nNote: You may use both \"Alexa, tell Quick Add\" and \"Alexa, ask Quick Add.\" This invocation format is different than the native Todoist integration was and is specified by Amazon to ensure smooth operation with Alexa. You might need a few tries to get used to this new way of adding tasks, but once you do, it\u2019ll become second nature!\n\nPro Tip: In addition to the \"to add [task] intent, you may also say: \"to log,\" \"to put,\" \"to task,\" and \"to create a task.\" For the shortest and easiest invocation say \"Alexa, tell Quick Add add [task].\" In addition to \"to add [task],\" you may also say \"Alexa, tell Quick Add\": \"to log [task],\" \"to put [task],\" \"to task [task],\" and \"to create a task [task].\"\n\nThis skill is independently created and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Doist.
