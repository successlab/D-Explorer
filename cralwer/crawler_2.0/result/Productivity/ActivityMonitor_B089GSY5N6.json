Activating the skill is a pre-requisite before you start interacting with it to use the below features.\n\nThe skill currently supports the following features:\n1. Adding Activity: To note the occurrence of an activity, you can just say it out loud, for example, ''I am watering my plants\" or \"I am taking the red pill\" etc. This would note the time of occurrence of the specified activity.\n\n2. Getting the last occurrence of an activity: If you want to know when you last did an activity, ask using phrases like, \"When did I water my plants?\" or \"When did I feed my dog?\". This will tell you the exact time of latest occurrence of the activity requested.\n\n3. Getting the count of activity: You can also track the frequency of any activity. For example, to know how many times you watered your plants this week, say, \"number of times I watered my plants this week?\" or \"count of watering plants since yesterday\". If no starting time if specified, the default count is for the present day.\n\n4. Listing your activities: To know what activities you have been doing, phrase your sentences like \"List activities this week\" or \"List activities since yesterday\" or \"List all activities\". \n\n5. Deleting the activity: You can delete the last occurrence of an activity if you feel you added it accidentally, by phrasing your sentence like, \"Delete activity watering plants\". To delete all the occurrences of an activity phrase your sentence like \"Delete all feeding dog\" .\n\n6. Asking for help: At any point, if you need help with any of the features listed above, say \"need help\"\n\nYou can also combine skill activation with any feature listed above. For example, you can say \" Alexa, ask activity monitor to add activity watering plants\" or \"Alexa, ask activity monitor to list activities\" etc.\n\nThis skill is very useful to keep track and get better insights on your daily activities. It can also be useful in situations where more than one person is responsible for an activity. In this situation, one person can add the activity and the other person can know the last occurrence of activity (for example, I walked the dog when my wife is asleep and have to leave for the office. I can add the activity using this skill and when my wife wakes up, she can know when the dog was taken for a walk last time).\nThis skill is also useful for people needing memory assistance due to any medical condition or elderly people. \n\nNotes: This skill only stores the occurrences since last 7 days because of memory limitations. If you need to track activities for more than 7 days, please leave a comment and based on the demand a premium version of the skill might be made available in subsequent releases. \n\nMore power to you! Thanks for your support :)", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
