Horizontal distance and angle to top of object are combined to give you an answer. Fancy equipment is not required, but ability to measure angle using either a dedicated clinometer or phone app. is preferred to get better results. Decimals may be used for both measurements, but not fractions (i.e. `ten point five feet`, but not `ten-and-a-half feet`).", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
