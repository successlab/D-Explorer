Well now you don't need to have that struggle any longer! With Gift Ideas for Alexa, you can simply tell the skill your idea and it will remember it for you and when you're ready for your ideas, simply ask Alexa again. It's that easy!\n\nCOMING SOON:\nWe intend to add specific birth date and event-specific gift idea tracking (i.e. you might have some ideas for someone specifically for Christmas vs. their birthday) and a Flash Briefing skill that will use those dates to remind you about shopping when those dates are getting close. Stay tuned for more!", "priv": ""}
