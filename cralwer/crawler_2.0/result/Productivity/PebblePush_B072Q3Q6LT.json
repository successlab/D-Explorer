Want a new way to add things to your timeline on the Pebble Smartwatches? Pebble Push was designed to solve these problems and it's actually quite simple.\n\nAfter simple setup (which can be found after enabling the skill), there are two ways of interacting with the skill:\n\n1) Provide Pebble Push with the Reminder, the time, and the day in which you'd like to be reminded. For example:\n \"Alexa, ask Pebble Push to remind me to Clean the Garage at 7pm tomorrow\"\n\nNOTE: The default values, if not replaced, for date and time is noon on the current day.\n\n2)Provide Pebble Push with the Reminder, and how many hours in the future you'd like to be reminded. For example:\n \"Alexa, ask Pebble Push to remind me in 6 hours to do the Math Homework\"\n\nNOTE: The default value, if not replaced, for the hours in the future is 1 hour.\n\n--DEV SUPPORT--\nThis was conceptualized and developed by a Computer Science Student at Purdue University. While studies come first, I am dedicated to improving Pebble Push to the best of my ability.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
