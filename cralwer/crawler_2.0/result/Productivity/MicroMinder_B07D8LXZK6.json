Then call them up while you go about your day. You'll never leave your keys at home again.\n\n\n### EXAMPLE\n\n\n```\nU: \"Alexa, ask Micro Minder to remember something.\"\n\nA: \"What should I remember?\"\nU: \"Remember my keys.\"\n\nA: \"When do you need this reminder?\"\nU: \"When I leave for work.\"\n...END\n\nU: \"Alexa, tell Micro Minder I'm going to work.\"\nA: \"Remember your keys.\"\n...END\n```\n\nIt's important that each user utterance takes the form of a whole sentence. For example, when trying to store a new reminder, Alexa says \"When do you need this reminder?\" - Valid responses that map as above would include:\n\n\"When I go to work\"\n\"When I am going to work.\"\n\"When I'm headed to work\"\n\"Before work\"\n...etc\n\nHowever, if the user responds simply: \"Going to work.\" - Alexa will invoke the skill as if the user is reporting their intent to leave for work, any existing reminders for this occasion will be returned, and the new reminder will not be saved.\n\n\n### TIPS\n\n\n* Reminders are recorded against the events in your life, we call these \"occasions.\" Rather than scheduling a reminder for \"tomorrow,\" you use Micro Minder to remind you of habitual and repetitive needs.\n\nThe phrases you use to describe occasions should be consistent. For instance, \"leaving home\" and \"going to work\" are not implicitly related occasions. On the other hand, all of these phrases map the the same occasion:\n\n\"Leaving for school,\"\n\"Going to school,\"\n\"Before school,\"\n...and so on.\n\n\n* While listening for your reminders, you can get them one at a time, or all at once:\n\n```\nU: \"Tell Micro Minder I'm going camping\"\nA: \"Remember your bug spray. Say next, for more.\"\nU: \"Make it brief.\"\nA: \"Remember your binoculars, your camp stove, and your skillet. That's all of your reminders for this occasion.\"\n```\n\n\n* You can resume reminder playback or recording at any time. Just say: \n\n\"Alexa, tell Micro Minder to resume.\"\n\n...and pick up where you left off.\n\n\n* You can remove a reminder from any of your occasions hands-free. Just say: \n\n\"Alexa, tell Micro Minder to remove a reminder.\"\n\n\n* Here are other valid commands:\n\n\"Demo\"\n\"Help\"\n\"Previous\"\n\"Repeat\"\n\"Start over\"\n\"Update my reminders\"\n\n\n### CHANGES\n\n\n* Added all-at-once intent.\n\n* Added resume capabilities.\n\n* Added hands-free reminder editing.\n\n* Added reminder display lists for compatible devices.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
