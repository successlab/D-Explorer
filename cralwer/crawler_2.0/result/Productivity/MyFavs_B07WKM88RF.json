It's a great way to surprise that special someone with a night out or dinner in that they\u2019ll truly appreciate! \n\nThe first step is to log a favorite restaurant, meal, or activity, just by saying, \u201cLog a favorite.\u201d You\u2019ll be asked a first name to log it under, the name of your favorite, whether it\u2019s a restaurant, meal, or activity and how you would rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. Once the favorites have been logged, you can:\n1. Review a list of them along with their rating by the name of the individual logging them. Just say, \u201cTell me my favorites.\u201d\n2. Change the rating for one of your favorites, by saying, \u201cChange the rating for one of my favorites.\u201d Alexa will then ask for the favorite\u2019s name and the new rating.\n3. Get a suggestion for a restaurant, meal or activity based upon the ratings, by starting the dialog with, \u201cMake a suggestion for a restaurant.\u201d\n\nFinally, a word or two about how My Favs makes its suggestions: The favorites for the requested category (restaurant, meal, or activity) are dynamically put into a list weighted according to their rating. Then we use a randomization function that identifies one from the list as the category suggestion. With this methodology, a favorite with a rating twice as high as another favorite should be twice as likely to be chosen as the suggestion. However, theoretically, any of the favorites could be selected on any one randomized drawing. Regardless of the math, My Favs is a fun way to make these selections. \n\nBe sure to try it and let us know how you like it!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
