Use it as a reward system, chore chart or virtual swear jar. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination!\n\nTo get started, say something like \"Create a jar for Bob\". This will create a virtual jar named Bob. To add marbles, say \"Add a marble to Bob\" or \"add five to bob\" (the former adding one marble and the latter adding 5 to Bob's jar). When a jar reaches 30 marbles, it's full and you will receive a congratulations message. You can remove Bob's jar by saying \"remove Bob\". You can hear the count in Bob's jar by saying \"count Bob\". To hear the count in all jars, just say \"count\" or \"count all\". You can also add 5 marbles to all jars by saying \"add five to all\". Likewise, you can remove all jars by saying \"remove all\". Premium content enables you to have more jars\n\n Finally, this skill does try to guess what you mean with alternate phrases so don't be afraid to experiment with what feels most natural to you. If you would rather say \"how many\" than \"count\" or \"place five marbles in bob\" than \"add five to bob\", go right ahead. However, try to avoid possessives whenever possible: Marble Jar has a much easier time figuring out what you mean when you refer to the jar belonging to Bob as just \"Bob\" and not \"Bob's jar\". \n\nGood luck and may the marbles be ever in your favor!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
