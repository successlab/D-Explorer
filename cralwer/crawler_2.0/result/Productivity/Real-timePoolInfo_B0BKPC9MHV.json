The pool information that can be requested allows a user to know straight away the Pool Temperature, incase it is to cold, it allows the user to ask what the Solar heating Temperature is, it also allows for the user to ask for the pool pH (a measure of the pool's acidity). \nThe way \u201cPool info\u201d gets this information is by connecting to two specific Thing speak Channels coming from Raspberry Pi, Temperature and pool PH, Clarity (ORP) probes connected to a pool filter pipes, which have a feed that directly updates the Thing speak channel databases.\nThis skill will allow you to use a number of phrases asking for,\n\"What is the Pool Temperature\"?\n\"What is the Solar Temperature\"?\n\"What is the Pool PH\"?\n\"What is the Air Temperature\"?\n\"What is the Pool Clarity (ORP)\"?\nEach command will provide you with a verbal output from the thing speak channel database and also present it to you visually if you have an Amazon Alexa display device (e.g. Alexa Show 5+).", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
