Affirmations are sentences aimed to affect the conscious and the subconscious mind. The words that combine to create the affirmation, automatically and involuntarily, bring up related mental images into the mind, which could inspire, energize and motivate. Repeating affirmations, and the resultant mental images, affect the subconscious mind, which in turn, influences the behavior, habits, actions and reactions.\n\nWhen you need a reminder, as you go through out your day, you can go the Alexa companion app to see the affirmation that you received that day.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
