Well... \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I am an expert in Executive & Corporate Recruitment + LinkedIn for job search and careers but the 1000's of Candidates I've worked with, 1000's of Job Searches I have run, and 13k+ connections I have would no doubt tell a different story. \n\nAlong the way, I've cracked the code on how to go from struggling to land a job interview to getting interviews that turn into offers to the job that makes Monday feel like a great day. \n\nNow, I'm super proud of what I do. I get to help people beat the struggle to land interviews and get better jobs after they have spent countless hours, days, weeks, months and even in some cases years looking for that right-fit job feeling. \n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always me. \n\nBefore all of this, I was an Executive Search, Corporate Recruitment and Certified LinkedIn Recruitment Expert. \n\nI was on the dark side (queue music... and \"dudududududuududuud ud dudu duduud ud dududuudududu nanananannananannanaanna ....\").\n\nNow that I've joined the resistance, I'm taking my 15+ years of experience and a ton of blood, sweat, and tears (some of them were even mine, JK) to hack the entire job search, interview, and career success process. All to help you cut the confusion, chaos, and clutter of finding the job that makes your Monday feel just as good as a Friday. \n\nSo, that is why they call me an expert...and I\u2019m incredibly proud of it, and of the people, I've helped along the way with many, many more to come.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
