Perhaps you had to run to the store or leave early for an event, and you needed to let someone else know. The Note Wall is a skill that can provide this functionality via Alexa.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. You say 'Alexa, ask The Note Wall to tell Brandon that the party is at 5.' Alexa remembers the note.\n2. Brandon arrives and asks 'Alexa, ask The Note Wall if there are any notes for Brandon.' Alexa will deliver your note.\n\nYou can learn who has active notes by saying 'Alexa, ask The Note Wall to read all the notes' or just 'Alexa, launch The Note Wall.'", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
