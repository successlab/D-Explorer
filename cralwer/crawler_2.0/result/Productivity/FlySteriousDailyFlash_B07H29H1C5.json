One time someone cute slapped us in the face with our own culture. Another time someone kind-of-cute claimed these sounds as a crucial piece of their mental health fitness routine. But we are not here to define any of this for you. We want you to remember that you are more than your job and your money and your human condition. \n\nYou have permission to giggle. Positivity and optimism dance inside the party of your laugh and we extend an invite requiring no RSVP. At Fly Sterious Daily Flash we encourage you to take from our sounds whatever it is you like. It could be a motivational mantra or a comforting inner music. A city ritual. A refreshing plant. Some friendly words. Makeshift art, food, science, and philosophy. It could even be like soft gentle rain and an ambient synthesizer combined to craft the ultimate ASMR and you're cozy in style wearing matching vintage sweaters with your favorite puppy before warm social mysteries of the most lit variety. \n\nMedia would have you believe in something far more rotten than your own ability to alter, transform, and improve this temporary Earth experience. In addition to the daily mental clutter, the odd is alive for you. Fly Sterious Daily Flash returns each day to offer a reminder. Just don't take it too seriously.\n\nInstagram\nhttps://bit.ly/2Dd66Z9\n\nSoundCloud\nhttps://bit.ly/2CDbxSB\n\nYouTube\nhttps://bit.ly/2QdZ4Yl", "priv": ""}
