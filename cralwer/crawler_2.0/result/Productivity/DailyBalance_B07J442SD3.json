Simply tell Alexa to add an item to your To-do list and it will automatically show up in DailyBalance instead. \nTo learn more about DailyBalance please visit dailybalanceapp.com. \n\nPREREQUISITES: To use this skill, it is required that you have a DailyBalance account already set up. When you enable this skill you will need to link it to your DailyBalance account, so please have your DailyBalance account credentials ready and follow the linking steps provided by the Alexa app. Also be sure to grant read and write permissions for the lists. \n\nHOW TO USE: For example, say 'Alexa, add Call Vet to my To-do list'. The skill will add 'Call Vet' to DailyBalance and it will show up in your 'Incoming' folder in the DailyBalance app.\n\nNOTE: This will effectively replace Alexa's built-in To-do list. Items will appear in the Alexa To-do list briefly but then will get marked as Completed. This is done so that there is no duplication of items in both Alexa To-do and DailyBalance.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
