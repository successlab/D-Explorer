A user may have any number of lists, with any number of entries. Lists and list entries are maintained in a DynamoDB database organized by Alexa UserID. In this way, the user may keep arbitrary lists for any purpose. Users may create lists, add entries to lists, delete entries, and delete entire lists using Alexa commands. This Alexa skill will work with an \"active list\". A user may switch between active lists with a command. When a new list is created it becomes the active list.\n\nCommands for this skill are as follows:\n\nTo create a new list, say \"Alexa, tell my lists to create list <list name>\"\nTo add an item to your active list, say: Alexa, tell my lists to add entry <entry name>\".\nTo switch to a different list say: \"Alexa, tell my lists, change list to <list name>\".\nTo delete a list, say: \"Alexa, tell my lists to delete list <list name>\".\nTo remove an entry from a list, say: \"Alexa, tell my lists to delete entry <entry name>\".\nTo say all of your lists, say: \"Alexa, ask my lists to tell me my lists\".\nTo list the entries in your active list, say: \"Alexa, ask my lists what are my entries\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
