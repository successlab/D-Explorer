Efficiency means many things to WizerFood, including cutting grocery bills, reducing time spent shopping, not missing as many items while shopping, reducing food waste, and more!\n\nProfile settings let you define your goals, such as focusing on budget, healthy choices or preparation time - among many other options. The app also goes beyond food, letting you keep track of anything measurable: your weight, your blood pressure, how far or long you exercise, etc. You can also add income and expense details, including recurring ones, which lets the app create a useful picture of possible future cash flow.\n\nThis skill requires a WizerFood account, which can be created for free at www.wizerfood.com.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
