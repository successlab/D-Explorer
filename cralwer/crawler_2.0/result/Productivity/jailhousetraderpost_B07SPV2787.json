However, one prisoner, Charick S. Callaway (a.k.a. \"Nasdaq\"), with the help of family and friends, has been able to accomplish such a feat despite the odds stacked against him. In 2013, \"Nasdaq\" made his very first stock trade from behind the walls of probably the worst jail in the United States - Baltimore City Detention Center. It was during this time that he coined the term \"Jailhouse Stock Trader.\"\n \nFrom a prison cell, this site was inspired to document a prisoner's personal quest in harnessing his very own negative emotions of being incarcerated into a positive transformation for change and rehabilitation through the stock market. In a simultaneous quest for redemption and equal justice, Nasdaq is equally dividing and donating a percentage of net proceeds from some profitable stock trades to two types of organizations - those that focus on empowering women and then to those that are addressing systematic racial and class injustice in the criminal justice system. In this journey, it is Nasdaq's hope that his efforts will inspire and educate viewers of this site to harness their very own unique negative experiences into positive transformations for change, either in the stock market or other areas of life. Nasdaq contributes his recent revelation and small success in the stock market to his new found relationship with his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, strong family support, and a determination to \"Making A Setback, A Payback, To Give Back!\"", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
