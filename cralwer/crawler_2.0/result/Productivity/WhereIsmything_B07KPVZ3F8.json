It's better to outsource this job to a free personal assistant, who can store all the details of the things or objects anywhere as you store them. Use your voice command and ask Alexa to store any object at home, and retrieve any information any time. Example : Say \"Remember\" \"Land registry documents is at my office desk at fourth rack\". Then ask alexa \"Where is my\" \"Land Registry documents\". Another example : \"Remember\" \"My old sticker book is in the shed\", then ask Alexa \"Where is my\" \"sticker book\". You can also update the location again for the same object, Alexa would retrieve the updated location. We also provide a mobile app for organizing manually, if you like to. Data is stored in a secured database on cloud for each user and not shared with anyone.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
