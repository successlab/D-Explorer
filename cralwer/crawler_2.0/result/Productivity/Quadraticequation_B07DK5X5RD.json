The skill finds the roots of the equation. It confirms the coefficients with the user, and states the sign of the discriminant.\nWhen prompted, the user supplies the quadratic coefficient \"a\", the linear coefficient \"b\", and the constant coefficient \"c\". The user may say things like \"negative five point three seven one\" and the skill will understand the coefficient to be \"-5.371\".\n\nNote that unlike similar skills, this one handles real coefficients that are not necessarily whole numbers.\n\nIf the discriminant is zero, there is only one real root, which is read aloud and output to the card for user reference.\nIf the discriminant is positive, both real roots are read out loud (and output to the card for reference).\nIf the discriminant is negative, both the roots are complex numbers. The real and imaginary parts of both roots are read out loud, and output to the card for reference.\n\nBy telling you the roots, this skill can help you complete the square or factor a binomial.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
