Then easily find them later. Request them by email, making them easy to share or open in your favourite mapping app or website.\n\nYou don't need a special device to use this skill; the Alexa app on your mobile device will work just fine! \n\nTo save a location, just say\n\n \"Alexa, tell Points of Interest to save this location\".\n\nWhy might you want to record a location?\n\nPerhaps you noticed a new \"For Sale\" sign on a home, and you'd like to research it later.\n\nMaybe it's an interesting shop, park, picnic spot, a great view, an unexplored trail for walking your dog, or just somewhere to come back to with a friend. \n\nOr perhaps you're driving, and you want to call in an incident or a road hazard as soon as it's safe to pull over.\n \nThis skill can save any location and email the details to your phone or computer for easy followup.\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nTo use this skill, it requires your permission to access three pieces of data about you:\n\n1. your email address\n2. your first name\n3. your location, on devices that support it.\n\nYou can control these permissions using this skill's settings in your Alexa app.\n\nLOCATION-AWARE FUNCTIONS\n\nTo save your location, you must be using a device that has Location Services support, and they must be enabled and the permissions granted (described above). For instance, a mobile phone with the Alexa app running, a wearable device connected to Alexa through the app, or an Alexa device in your car.\n\nTo check that location services are working, try saying \n\n \"Alexa, where am I ?\"\n\nIf Alexa can answer that question, location services are available, and with permissions granted this skill can use your location.\n\nYOUR SAVED LOCATIONS\n\nAlso known as your waypoints, points of interest or your trip, your saved locations are stored securely by the skill. \n\nThe skill remembers up to ten locations for you. If you store an eleventh location, the oldest one is removed to make way for the new one. You can delete your saved locations and start fresh by launching the skill then saying\n\n \"Delete my locations\"\n\nACCESSING YOUR SAVED LOCATIONS\n\nWhen you want to access your saved locations, you can request a \"trip report\", which is sent to your Alexa app, shown on screen if you have a display device, and delivered to you instantly by email.\n\nYour email trip report is the most useful feature of the skill. It includes not only full details of each saved location, but also links to open popular mapping apps and websites for instant research. It's also easy to forward the email to others, editing it if necessary, for instance to share a rendezvous location, report a lost or found item or a traffic incident. To get your trip report, say\n\n \"Send me a trip report\"\n\nUSER GUIDE\n\nThis skill has a comprehensive User Guide describing ALL its features in detail. It's available as a PDF document when you say\n\n \"Send me the User Guide\"\n\nWe recommend you scan the User Guide for more examples of things you can say to the skill and ideas for using it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER FUNCTIONS\n\nSETTINGS\n\nTo select between popular mapping services for links in your trip report, say\n\n \"choose map service\"\n\nCREDITS\n\nBackground music: www.bensound.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
