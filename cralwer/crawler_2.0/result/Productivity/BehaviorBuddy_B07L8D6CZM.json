This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: behavior buddy", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Behavior Buddy allows you to quickly capture random behaviors by saying \"Alexa, ask behavior buddy to add a behavior\". This will walk you through three quick prompts to capture the behavior. The three prompts it will ask are: \"What was the behavior?\", this can be one word phrases such as: kicking, biting, hitting, pinching, screaming, etc. Once the behavior has been captured, the skill will ask for what happened leading up to the behavior. At this point, you can either say something like \"he/she was watching his favorite show\", OR, you can say stop to just log the behavior to see how frequently it is occuring. If you provided the Antecedent, the skill will then follow up and ask for what happened after the behavior. At this time, you can say something like \"I blocked the behavior and redirected him/her to a new activity\". Once the consequence has been captured, the skill will save the behavior to your behavior buddy notes. If you have any behaviors logged over the course of a week or two and want to email them to yourself, you can simply say \"Alexa, ask behavior buddy to send my behaviors\". At this time it will send your behavior log to your email you have logged in to the Alexa system with. NOTE: if you haven't granted the skill permission to access your email, you will need to do so from within the Alexa mobile app. To do this, simply open the \"Behavior Buddy\" skill in the \"Skills & Games\" section of the Alexa app, then tap \"Your skills\" and select \"Behavior Buddy\". Then, tap on \"Settings\" then \"Manage Permissions\". You will then need to toggle the \"Email Address\" option. Finally, tap \"Save Permissions\". Once this is complete, you can now re-ask behavior buddy to send your behaviors. The last option you have with Behavior Buddy is to delete all behaviors. In order to do this, simply say \"Alexa, ask behavior buddy to delete behaviors", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
