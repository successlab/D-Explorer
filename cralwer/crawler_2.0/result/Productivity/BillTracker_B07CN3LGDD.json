To use this feature you will need to allow permission for Bill Tracker to do reminders whilst enabling this skill or at any time later using the skill Settings in the skill page of the Alexa App. Having reminders enabled means that when you next add bills you will be given the option of being reminded on your device a few days in advance of the due date.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBill Tracker helps you keep track of your bills as they come in. Tell Alexa to add a bill or ask her to read out upcoming bills.\n\nThis skill will help you know when your bills are coming up and assist you to forecast future household expenditure. Sometimes when you get a bill in the mail you may not want to pay it straight away, but you don't want to forget it! So open Bill Tracker and yell out some basic details as Alexa prompts you through the process. The skill will maintain the basic information about the bills and can be accessed by asking Bill Tracker to read them out.\n\nThere is a main menu upon launch of the skill, however here are the streamlined commands for adding and reading bills. \n\nTo add a bill here are the options:\n- Alexa, ask Bill Tracker to add a bill\n\nAlexa will prompt you for a bill type (e.g. electricity), bill amount (e.g. 50 dollars) and due date (e.g. 4th of July).\nIf you have enabled reminders then Alexa will offer to set a reminder a few days ahead of the bill due date.\n\nThen to check your bills simply say:\n- Alexa, ask Bill Tracker to read my bills\n\nAlexa will ask you if you've paid the bill, if you say 'yes' then the bill will not be mentioned again. If you say 'no' then the bill will continue to be read out.\n\nYou can reset all the bills by saying 'Remove all my bills'.\n\n\nIf you have suggestions or issues, please leave a comment or contact steven.bowden@protonmail.com directly.\n\nPrivacy information\nThe Bill Tracker skill stores basic self asserted non-verified information about your bills.
