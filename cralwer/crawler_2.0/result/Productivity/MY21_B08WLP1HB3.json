If you feel like spending more - please do, but don\u2019t tire yourself - the game objective is to complete 21 active days.\n\nYou\u2019ll play with a virtual guide, Sam, sharing reports once your daily activity is complete. If you don\u2019t check in, the game will automatically restart from Day #1.\n\nMY21 can also track your energy levels throughout the 21-day cycle. Your responses will be summed up in a convenient report at the end of the game & never shared with anyone but you. \n\nGot it? Then let\u2019s begin!\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\n1. Ask Alexa to \u201cOpen MY 21\u201d.\n\n2. Tell MY21 what you want to do & start the game.\n\n3. During the next 21 day, dedicate at least 20 minutes a day to the chosen Activity.\n\n4. Share daily reports with MY21 - with or without reminder. \n\n5. (Optionally): share your daily energy levels to receive a summary report at the end.\n\nThe game objective is to complete 21 active days.\n\nPlease remember: If you don't report in, the game will restart from day #1.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nMY21 is in active development. If there's anything we can do to make it better, please email Alex at Alex@2021.works - your candid feedback is super important to us!\n \nIf you like MY21, we'd really appreciate it if you'd leave a review and, perhaps, recommend us to a friend. \n\nwww.2021.works\nwww.instagram.com/2021.stories", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
