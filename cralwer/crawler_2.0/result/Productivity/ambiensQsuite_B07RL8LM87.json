This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: environmental platform", "reviewnum": " 3", "des": "If you are a user of the ambiensQsuite platform, you have at your disposal this Skill designed for you to make queries about specific variables. AmbiensQsuite is an environmental platform designed to manage the comprehensive management of various environmental components such as noise, air, water and meteorology, as well as the management, control and organization of documents and elements common to these, in order to track data, obtain analysis graphs, indicators and statistics that help in the monitoring of environmental events and in decision making.\nOur Skill connects directly to the data of the stations, equipment and variables of the ambiensQsuite environmental platform so that it can be used at any time for a quick consultation of the most recent data recorded and alert reporting, avoiding access to the platform for these specific queries. To use this tool, your web platform username and password are not required, but you must provide the access code that identifies you as a user. You can find this code by accessing the platform's personal data menu. In addition, you must know how your company's network is made up, which stations and which variables are monitored. It is an exclusive Skill for ambiensQsuite users.\nTo begin with, you can query Alexa using the command \"Alexa, start environmental platform\", to find out the values of the variables measured at the stations in your company's network. You must be clear about the station and variable that you want to consult, since Alexa will ask you for this information and will use it to make the report.\nYou can receive more information about the ambiensQsuite platform by going to http://ambiensq.com/ or http://www.aitesol.com/", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
