This brief starts with a \"did you know?\" question and answer. Then it delivers a historical fact which happened years ago on the same day you are listening. Lastly, there is an inspirational quote.\n\nThere is a new brief Monday through Friday.\n\nBonjour! literally means \"good day\" in French and -- if like me -- you were born and raised there, or you happened to travel there for a visit you heard that word a lot! Bonjour is the first word you hear upon waking. You hear it upon entering a store, arriving at school or at work, when seeing your friends or strangers. You get my point.\n\nI wanted Bonjour! to be fun and inspiring. \n\nSorry, you have to provide your own coffee.\n\nFor the sake of honesty, the gorgeous part was added because Amazon got finicky and no longer accepted title shorter than 8 letters. Gorgeous seemed fitting. So there you go Gorgeous enjoy your day!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
