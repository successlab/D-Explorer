They may be handymen, painters, dentists, lawyers or doctors that your friends have used and recommend. For instance, when your toilet starts to leak & you need a plumber fast, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to ask Your Expert Log than trying to remember the name of that plumber your friend Joe had told you about three months earlier? \n\nOur friends often recommend experts who have provided reliable, outstanding services. The problem is being able to recall the name of the expert or who made the recommendation when we need that skill. It could be a house painter or a cardiologist. With Your Expert Log, you log the expert soon after you hear your friend\u2019s recommendation. Then, whenever you need someone with that skill you can ask Your Expert Log to tell you the experts in that skill category. The five categories are Health, Home, Legal, Finance, and Other.\nWith Your Expert Log you can:\n1. Log an expert\n2. Find an expert by searching one of the five categories of experts, or\n3. Delete an expert\n\nAfter using Your Expert Log for a while, you\u2019ll wonder how you ever got along without it!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
