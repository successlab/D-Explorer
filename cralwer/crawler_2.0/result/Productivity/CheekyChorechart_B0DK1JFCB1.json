You can ask Alexa to read the list of chores that are assigned to you each day, and you can log your chores as you complete them. Alexa won't let you forget, I promise you'll see what I mean. You can even keep score and compete with other household members to see who finishes first...Or who owes who dinner. The chore tracker automatically resets on Sunday each week to reset the quirky competition. May the laziest lose (while everyone else home watches.)\nThis skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
