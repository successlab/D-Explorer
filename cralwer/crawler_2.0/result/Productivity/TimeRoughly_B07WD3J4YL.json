Great for when you only want to know about what time it is, you're feeling lazy and only need to know the time roughly or for people with dyscalculia (numeric dyslexia). \n\nTo use, just ask \"Alexa, ask Time Roughly\" and it will return the current time to the nearest quarter hour. You can also say \"Alexa, ask Time Roughly what is five fifty in the evening\" to get nearest quarter hour to the given time (a quarter to 5pm in this case). When asking for a particular time, Time Roughly will stay open so you can ask for another time, e.g. \"what is four twenty two in the morning?\". You can also ask Time Roughly for help for a short audio description of what you can do.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
