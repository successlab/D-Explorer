This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: birthday alerts", "reviewnum": " 2", "des": "Add birthdays and get an Alert on the day of each birthday. You can choose the time on each day for the alert. Further more you can choose which devices you want the alert to fire. \n\nTo add a birthday just say, add a birthday for the person's name on the date at a time. If you just say add a birthday it will ask for the additional information.\n\nOnce you've added birthday alerts on one device you can go to a different device and accept the birthday alerts one by one.\n\nAll new users get 5 birthdays free for all time. Each year the birthday alert will need to be renewed according to the rules about reminders which is a person has to agree to every change to a reminder on every device. After the alert has run, the next time you start the skill you will be asked to renew the birthday. Similarly if you want the alert to run on a different echo device running the skill on that device will result in being asked to activate the alert for each birthday. You can hear the names of all of your birthdays and get the details by saying \"when is the birthday for Fred\", for example. If you want to change the birth date for someone just add that birthday again and it will update on your current device. Note the birthday names are unique you cannot have more than one entry for the same name. When you next run the skill on your other devices you will be prompted to agree any updates one by one. Similarly you can delete a birthday on a device by saying \"delete the birthday for Fred\". To delete that birthday on other devices run the skill on each device and it will prompt you with all queued deletes. This may seem a bit clunky but it is required by the policies on dealing with reminders on devices, meaning a person has agreed for every change on each device.\n\nIf users want more than 5 birthday they can buy more in packs of 5. These also can be used for all time. You can ask at any time \"how many alerts do I have\" and \"what have I bought\".\n\nTo see the example user experience view this video https://youtu.be/g_4QBJKal8A", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
