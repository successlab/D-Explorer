Also, you can receive optional notifications on your Alexa devices regarding activity on your WhenToWork account, such as time off approvals and work schedule changes.\n\nBefore adding this skill, you should already be a user of WhenToWork. The easiest way add this skill is to use the WhenToWork desktop browser application on the employee's INFO tab, or use the WhenToWork mobile app under My Info & Settings -> Smart Assistants. Both of these methods combine the enabling and the account linking steps into one continuous action for simplicity. Alternately, you can add this skill using the Amazon companion app by searching for the skill named \"work assistant\", or just say \"Alexa, open work assistant\" from any of your Alexa devices, but this will require additional steps to link your WhenToWork account to Alexa. In either case, Work Assistant will provide instructions along the way to complete the setup. \n\nAfter your account setup is complete, just say \"help\" from within your Work Assistant session for a summary of things you can do.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
