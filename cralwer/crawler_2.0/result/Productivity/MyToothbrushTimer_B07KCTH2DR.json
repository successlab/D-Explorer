Since you probably can't hear Alexa very well while you're brushing your teeth, the only time she'll say anything is when it's time to switch.\n\nTip: It's probably best to get the toothpaste on your toothbrush before you start My Toothbrush Timer.\n\nPlease send us an email with your suggestions at MRadio.Dev+mtt@gmail.com.
