Do you know how much water you use in the shower? Probably not, it's hard to keep track of! Let Shower Buddy do it for you and when you finish your shower you'll see how much water you used. It will also translate to more relatable, fun quantities such as cans of soda or pots of coffee. This can help us be more conscious about how much water we actually use and promote cutting back in even the smallest ways like shorter showers.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
