In reality, we use all of our brain, just not all at once. Different parts of the brain are active at different times, depending on what we're doing. Even when we're sleeping, our brain is still active.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis Alexa skill is purely an interface to the Claude AI chatbot developed by Anthropic.
