Those around us will absolutely have an effect on us, and once we realize this, we will start to make it work for ourselves and for our future. If you are looking for books on professional development, The Theory of 5 is the one!\n\n \n\nIn his new book, The Theory of 5, Chris Saraceno outlines one of the most powerful philosophies the truly successful hold: We don\u2019t have to do it alone. By seeking out those who have achieved what we dream of having in various areas of our lives and then asking them for guidance, we can build our own path to happiness and prosperity.\n\n\nSaraceno \u2014 a business executive, real estate investor, speaker and leader \u2014 knows firsthand how much of a difference mentors, co-mentors, role models and good friends can make. He can trace all the good things in his own life back to those who encouraged him and showed him the power of setting goals. These people demonstrated, in both words and action, how to build a life that matters.\n\n\nThe Theory of 5 \u2014 which recently topped the Amazon charts in the \u201cPersonal Success and Spirituality,\u201d\n\u201cCommunication in Business\u201d and \u201cReligious Leadership\u201d categories \u2014 examines the five areas that contribute most to prosperity in life: Spirituality, Marriage, Parenting, Business, and Finance and Health. On each topic, Saraceno shares how to find coaches, teachers and friends who can walk with us through life. \u201cIron sharpens iron,\u201d Saraceno said. \u201cBy challenging others and having them challenge us, we can bring out the best in each other and achieve the goals we could only dream of before.\u201d\n\n\nIn addition, The Theory of 5 offers an extensive interview section where Saraceno has asked business leaders, personal role models and other highly successful people about the lessons they\u2019ve learned from their own mentors. The book includes interviews with people who have touched the author\u2019s life \u2014 Dave Anderson, Dale Pollak, Chip Perry, Susan Givens, Grant Cardone, David Boice, Lee Kemp, Evelyn Longworth, Jerry H. Pyle, Jim O\u2019Connor and Sean Wolfington. Each share some of the methods they\u2019ve used to achieve successful, well-rounded lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cSurrounding yourself with the right circle of people can make all the difference in life,\u201d Saraceno said. \u201cI can say this because I\u2019ve witnessed the transformation both in my own life and in the lives of those around me who have\ntaken this idea to heart. This book has been a labor of love, and I know it can unlock the potential of anyone who reads it and puts it into action.\u201d", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
