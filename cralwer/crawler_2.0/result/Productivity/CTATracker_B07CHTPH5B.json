Requires a bit of a set-up, but it is well worth it.\n\nThere are two phases to this skill:\n\n1) Set-up phase (It takes about 5 minutes):\n\na) You will be asked what type of transit you need to track (Bus/Train).\nb) Then you will be asked (depending on your choice) the train line color or bus stop route; and the specific stop ID of the stop or station.\nc) Stop IDs can be retrieved from: \n Buses: https://www.transitchicago.com/schedules/\n Trains: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme/data\nd) Then you have the option of saving said stop. (Using something simple is recommended)\ne) You can set up as many stops/stations as you want.\n\n2) Tracking phase:\n\nAt this point you will have some saved stops. All you need to do is say track <insert name here> and it will track your bus/train.\n\nImportant information:\n- Try to be patient during the set-up phase. Your responses need precisely match the directions in the skill.\n- Make sure to keep trying. Alexa may not pick up exactly what you are saying in one go. Try exiting the skill and restarting it if you keep experiencing issues.\n- When saying bus route numbers such as, 157 you must say one-hundred fifty-seven instead of one-fifty-seven\n- When providing bus information you must exactly say: <bus number> bus at <bus stop id>.\n- When providing train information you must exactly say: <train line color> train at <train stop id>.\n- Once you pass the set-up phase it is quite simple to track your trains/buses.\n- Please consider giving feedback on how the skill can further be improved!\n\nYou can contact me at dxliang12@gmail.com with any questions and/or comments.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
