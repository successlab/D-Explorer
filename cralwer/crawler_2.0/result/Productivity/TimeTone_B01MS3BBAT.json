Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!\n\nThere are two modes: \nMode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.\n\nMode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.\nMode two format is as follows: \ntick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.\n\nTo use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:\n\nTo Begin:\nAlexa, ask time tone to play. This defaults to the first mode.\nAlexa, ask time tone for first. Plays the first mode.\n\nAlexa, ask time tone for second. Plays the second mode.\nAlexa, ask time tone for rain. Plays the second mode.\n\n\nTo end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):\nAlexa, ask time tone to end. \nAlexa, ask time tone finish.\n\nDisclaimer: Timer accuracy is dependent on a variety of factors, including network latency and reliability. Not meant for mission-critical/time sensitive tasks.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
