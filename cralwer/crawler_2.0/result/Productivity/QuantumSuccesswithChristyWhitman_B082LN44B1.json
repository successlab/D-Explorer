This includes the energy, the healing, the partner, the money and the feelings and define your ideal life. \n\nYou simply have to ask for what you want and need.\n\nWhen you embrace the Law of Attraction, you will start to unlock an inner power. A power that allows you to effortlessly attract what you want. Finding inner alignment through energy mastery is the key to creating the success you want in all areas of your life\u2014career, relationships, and self. By embracing your power to shift thought patterns that limit you, you\u2019ll naturally think abundant thoughts, and you\u2019ll find yourself struggling less and less to create what you want with ease.\n\nAbundance Is Your Birthright\nEnergy Healing Is Your Responsibility\nUniversal Laws are the Path to Freedom\n\nAre you ready to begin a journey of energy mastery towards abundance? Embrace your power and begin manifesting with ease. It all starts with you. It starts with finding and revealing the real you and understanding the rules of the universe that allow you to do so. So whether you\u2019re just embarking on your personal journey or you seek to master energy, I\u2019m here to help you along every step of the way. Everyone\u2019s destination will be different, but the path will be universal.\n\nThe Core Beliefs We Live By\n\n1. YOU are the energy master of your own life. You embody energy healing and have the power to improve your circumstances.\n\n2. All-that-is loves and adores you, and is always helping you and healing you.\n\n3. You direct this unlimited flow of energy wherever you want, allowing you to manifest.\n\n4. It is your Divine Nature to create. This creation is invigorating.\n\n5. You have an unbreakable connection with your Divine Self. This connection is an unlimited, constant flow of good energy that permeates everything you do and experience.\n\n6. You are the center of consciousness through which the power of the Source flows and connects with your Divine Self. When you reach within, your other mind becomes the channel for that power.\n\n7. Your life is your one, true \u201cLife Partner\u201d and you are never separated from it.\n\n8. There are no problems. If you perceive something as a problem, it will become a reality. You can prevent this. This is one of the guaranteed laws of the universe.\n\n9. Lower level emotions are not who you are. They are merely a part of your personality development. Spiritual cleansing can help you elevate your emotions, opening you up to manifest what you desire.\n\n10. You don\u2019t have to suffer. Drama, chaos and pain are illusions and stem from a limited mind. Your Divine Design was not made for this. Through energy healing and spiritual cleansing, you have the power to leave this limited perspective behind.\n\n11. Humans are spiritual beings in temporary physical form living in a material world for the joy of it. Your actual state of existence is between two worlds.\n\nChristy Whitman is a New York Times bestselling author, transformational leader, and Master Certified Law of Attraction Coach.
