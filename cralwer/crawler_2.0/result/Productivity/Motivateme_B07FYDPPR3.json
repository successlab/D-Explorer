This skill will give you a motivational quote on a random order. It contains powerful quotes from one of the best entrepreneurs, wealthy and overall successful people in life that will help you go the extra mile. I'm planning to expand this skill at the point when it will start motivating you for 1-2 minutes depending on the topic you want to choose. The current version contains 20-30 quotes from a wealthy and successful people. I will go and expand the list to hundreds even thousands of quotes. \n\nTo start this skill you need to ask \"Alexa, open motivation quotes\" and then add it to your skills. Then you will be able to say \"Alexa, give me a motivation quote\" or \"Alexa, give me a quote\" and it will randomly give you a quote.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
