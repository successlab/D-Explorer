We created this skill to replace the Alexa Shopping List because the Alexa app is absolutely\nterrible to use at the grocery store. Not only is it clunky to get to the list in the Alexa app, but\nit is often completely unresponsive -- especially when there is no wifi or weak cell signal inside\nthe store.\n\nTodoist, on the other hand, works perfectly at the grocery store. It also makes it easy to share\nyour Shopping List with all of your household members. Basically, it's better in every conceivable\nway.\n\nLink your Todoist account to Your Mom in the Alexa app to get started.\n\nSee the link for \"Developer Terms of Use\" for complete documentation for how to use this skill.\n\nYour Mom can:\n\n- Add Tasks (items) to any Project (list) in your Todoist account\n- Read the items on your list\n- Mark items as complete\n- Easily switch between lists\n\nBy default, Your Mom will add tasks to your Inbox, but we recommend creating a dedicated project for your shopping list and sharing it with other members of your household!\n\nRecommended usage:\n\n- Create a project called Shopping List in Todoist\n- Share the Shopping List project with your family members\n- Say, \"Alexa, ask Your Mom to use Shopping List\"\n- Say, \"Alexa, ask Your Mom to add bananas\"\n- Use the Todoist app to view your Shopping List on your phone at the grocery store\n- Rejoice at how easy Your Mom has made your life! \ud83d\ude4c", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
