Like every good coach, it will not tell you which decision it think is best for you, but instead leverage you own wisdom and judgement: Decision Coach asks you about some aspects of your life, and which options scores best in each of those aspects. In the end, it will determine which option scored best, and gives you your result.\n\nYou can start Decision Coach by any of these types of phrases:\n- \"Alexa, launch Decision Coach\"\n- \"Alexa, tell Decision Coach I need to make a decision between three options\"\n- \"Alexa, ask Decision Coach whether I should watch a movie or go to the gym.\"\n\nIf one question doesn't make sense in your context, you can let Decision Coach know and it will move on to the next question:\n- \"I don't know\"\n- \"This doesn't really matter\"\n- \"Skip question\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
