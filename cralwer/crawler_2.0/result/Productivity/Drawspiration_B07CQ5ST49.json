In other words, if you ever need creative inspiration, just say, \"Alexa, open drawing inspiration!\"\n\nSome generated examples:\n * A jittery, frightened, 3-winged kangaroo\n * A cow\n * A 1-armed, 6-legged, playful platypus\n\nDidn't understand what Alexa said? Don't worry, just follow the instructions Alexa says after the idea and Alexa will repeat it for you, this time slowly!\n\nWant a fun party idea?? Turn Drawspiration into a game!\n * Step 1: Gather some friends.\n * Step 2: Get some drawing materials (pens and paper).\n * Step 3: Get a timer and determine how long each person gets to make a drawing (1 or 2 minutes is a good, stressfully-funny amount of time).\n * Step 4: Have someone say, \"Alexa, open Drawspiration.\" Once everyone understands what Alexa said, start the timer, and have everyone start drawing!\n * Step 5: Once the time is up, the players have to stop drawing.\n * Step 6: Have the players vote on whose drawing is best. The one with the highest vote wins the round and gets a point!\n * Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 three or more times (however much you want). The person with the highest score at the end wins!\n * In the case of a tie, have a draw off! Have all of the tied players draw a new idea. The one with the highest score wins! (repeat if there is another tie). \n\nWant more/better stuff? Here's a list of planned improvements:\n * \u2611 Alexa show integration.\n * \u2610 Better pronunciations of words.\n * \u2610 Remembering your last prompt so you can exit the skill.\n * \u2610 Daily prompts (so you can compare with others!).\n * \u2610 Daily visit counter (if you visit a few days in a row, Drawspiration will have a surprise!).\n * \u2610 Drawspiration - Challenge Mode (basically the game but with built in timers).\n\nWant something else?\n * Please feel free to leave me a review with suggestions! I prefer 5 stars, but please, rate me what you think I deserve ;)\n * If you think this is a 1 or 2 star skill at the moment, please let me know what it would take to make this better at support@drawspiration.com\n\nHaving issues?\n * Please reach out to support@drawspiration.com\n\nCurious about the icon?\n * It was made by Paige Green.
