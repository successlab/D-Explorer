Using the Pomodoro technique, you\u2019ll increase your productivity by doing more in less time. \nThe length of time to which the work is divided is conventionally called \u201ctomato\u201d. Work Tomato is a cycle of 4 \u201ctomatoes\u201d. One \"tomato\" lasts for 30 minutes: 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest. \n\nAfter 4 tomatoes are gone it is recommended to take a longer break of 15-20 minutes or more if it is a lunch time for example. After the longer break just say \u201cAlexa, open Work Tomato\u201d and the cycle will start again.\n\nNote: This skill is in no way associated with the \u201cPomodoro Technique\u201d, \u201cPomodoro\u201d and Francesco Cirillo.\nThe Pomodoro Technique\u00ae and Pomodoro\u2122 are registered trademarks by Francesco Cirillo.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
