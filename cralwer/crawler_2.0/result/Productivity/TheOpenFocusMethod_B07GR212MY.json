By changing how you focus your attention you can change your complete experience of life. Some of the changes that others have experienced, and that you can look forward to as well, include better sleep, improved sports performance, reduction and elimination of physical and emotional pain, reduction and elimination of anxiety and depression, an increased sense of well being, and more.\n\nThe ideal use of The Open Focus Method is to listen to the Introduction To Open Focus and the Introduction To Open Focus Practice tracks. After that, continue with the Head and Hands track. Listen to and practice this track for two weeks. Then move on to the next track.\n\nThe Open Focus Training Library of recordings is available through a subscription. Your subscription has a seven day trial period. You can cancel anytime, but we hope you\u2019ll stay with the practice and achieve the incredible benefits of Opening Your Focus.\n\nHow is Open Focus training different from relaxation techniques, mindfulness, meditations, peak performance exercises, and other transformative methods? All these techniques work because they bring about an attention change. It\u2019s the changing of one\u2019s attention that underpins all methods that bring about physical and emotional change. However, Open Focus is the only one that directly trains the user in how to identify and employ attention training. This method simply and directly trains attention, the most basic behavior we engage in, and the one that transforms us.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
