Knowing is healing, and Julie has taught me the process of transition from our physical to back to our spirit.\u201d \u2013 D.J. Bright\n\n\u201cThis wonderful heart warming book dismisses the fears of the dying process and going into a void alone. I would recommend this book for those with a fear of death, those grieving a lose and those that have loved ones who are ill and transitioning. \u201d- Dianne Morgan\n\n\u201cThis book is really informative. Julie's perspective of a sort of \"countdown\" makes you realize it's a natural process, not to be feared, but to be experienced. So glad I found her book because the information makes a difficult situation, from a broader view, much easier to understand and accept.\u201d \u2013 Stacey Moore\n\n\n\nAbout Julie Ryan\nHello, I\u2019m a medical intuitive. I can facilitate energetic healings, I can see energy fields\u2014and I can communicate with spirits both alive and dead. I can work from anywhere; it\u2019s rare I\u2019m with someone while scanning them.\n\nIn addition, I can scan animals, access people\u2019s past lives, and remove ghosts from homes and other buildings, and I can tell how close to death someone is.\n\nAlthough the medical intuitive aspect of my life has been an amazing side interest, I\u2019m basically a businesswoman, an inventor, an author, and a serial entrepreneur. During my 35-year career, I\u2019ve invented surgical devices that are sold throughout the world and founded several companies in the medical, natural gas, advertising, long-term care, compliance, and data breach prevention industries.\n\n\n\u2022 To learn more about Julie Ryan visit: AskJulieRyan.com\n\u2022 Listen to Julie Ryan's Podcast: askjulieryan.com/podcast/", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
