Because life is so much more than just surviving. Human kind: we exist and are unique but for some reason society puts us in a stereotypical box. I am here to prove that as scary and hard as it may seem to be authentic, the real way to find happiness in your life and find that fantastic is by discovering what is outside the box. Each one of us matters. Let's laugh, diet, work, believe, grow and exist together.\n\nWhen you need to find something fantastic just ask. It may not be what you think it should be or how you think fantastic looks but it will give you an authentic clear answer for something that breaks the stereotype of your day. Curious what that means? Just ask Alexa for some help.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
