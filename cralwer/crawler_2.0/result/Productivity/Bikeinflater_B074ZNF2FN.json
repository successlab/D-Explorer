Optimal tire inflation pressure depends on many factors, but tire width and rider weight are most important in determining a good starting pressure that can later be tweaked.\n\nInspired by recommendations from the cycling experts at Schwalbe, this tool calculates a good starting inflation pressure for you, so you don't have to clean the grease off your hands and look up the tire inflation table online every time you need to fill tires with air. \n\nGetting started is as easy as:\n\n\"Alexa, ask bike inflater how much I should inflate my tires.\"\n\nYou'll be asked to clarify tire width and rider weight, and Alexa will give you a good starting pressure in both PSI and Bars. You can also give Alexa all the information she needs in a single question:\n\n\"Alexa, ask bike inflater for a good starting pressure for a 23 c. tire and 140 pound rider.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
