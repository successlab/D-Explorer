This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: pixel pet", "reviewnum": " 19", "des": "Pixel Pet is the perfect designer desk pet. \nIt has most sizes memorised, so just ask for a size and have it read it out to you as you type it down on your art board settings. If you didn't get it just ask and Pixel Pet will repeat it out to you. \n\nYou can ask for a size in any unit you'd like and even just the height or width of that size\ne.g.: Alexa Ask Pixel Pet, what is the height of an iPhone in pixels?\n\nPixel pet was conceived with the following work flow in mind:\n1. Open up your software and open a new art board/ Canvas.\n2. Ask Pixel Pet for your size in the units you'd like them in.\n3. Type out the values in the corresponding fields as it is dictated.\n4. Ask for it to be repeated if you'd like.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it just ask for the size with a single word. The units will default to pixels and you'll get your answer.\ne.g.: Alexa ask Pixel Pet, A9\n\nThis skill is meant to help enhance your work flow and make the process of finding a size easier. Rather than checking with google and copy pasting the values as you go back and forth between browser and software, Simply ask and Pixel Pet will read it out to you.\n\nIf there's a size you'd like added or for any questions/suggestions please do write to me at hello@rajathbail.com. Hope this helps you!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
