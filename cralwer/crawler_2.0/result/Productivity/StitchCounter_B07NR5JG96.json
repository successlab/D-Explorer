Thanks to the voice interaction you do not even have to put down your work to record that you finished a row or some stitches. \nAll of the counters are being saved also when you close the skill. So don't worry if you cannot get everything done in one go. Just come back to the project and resume where you left off whenever you wish.\n\nAre you doing Amigurumi?\nThen I am sure this skill is particularly helpful for you!\nWhenever you have to grow every 5th stitch in a round of 50 stitches you might easily get confused especially when you do not have a stitch marker or you grew tired of it. \nJust tell stitch counter to count 50 stitches and every 5 stitches you say that you finished 5 stitches. \nAnd this is how you can easily keep track of your counting with keeping your hands on the project!\n\nHave fun working on your favorite project!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
