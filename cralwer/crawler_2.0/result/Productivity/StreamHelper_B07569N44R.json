This will allow the bot to post the link of the newly created clip into your channels chat.\n\nIMPORTANT (Existing users): If you are an existing user of the skill, you will need to re-authenticate with Twitch in order to use the new create a clip feature. Simply disable the Stream Helper skill, re-enable it and link your Twitch account again. \n\nTwitch Stream Helper allows you to quickly get up to date information about your followers, subscribers and viewers. You can ask questions about the number of followers, subs, or viewers you have. In addition you can ask who your last subscriber or follower was as well as the last five followers and subscribers. You can also ask for the stream up time to see how long you have been streaming for.\n\nTo get set up all you need to do is link the skill with your Twitch account. Simply sign in with your Twitch account and authorize the skill to have access.\n\nNote about clip creation:\n- When you create a clip, Twitch's API will create a new clip that will default to 30 seconds prior to when you invoked the intent. You can then edit the clip on Twitch from 1min 30seconds prior to you invoking the skill to the moment that it was invoked. After an epic moment happens it is usually best to wait 5-15seconds before creating the clip that way you can capture both before and after the epic moment. \n \nThis skill is unofficial, and not in any way endorsed by twitch.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
