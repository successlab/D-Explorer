The suggested tasks can help you get organized at work (e.g send some quick emails) or at home (e.g unload the dishwasher) or become more mindful (e.g take a few deep breaths) and caring (e.g text your loved one to say \u201cI love you\u201d).", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
