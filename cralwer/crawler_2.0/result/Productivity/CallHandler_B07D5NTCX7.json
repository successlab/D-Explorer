This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: call handler", "reviewnum": " 333", "des": "Call Handler rejects unwanted phone calls for you. It also play 'on hold' music - just like an expensive phone system, allowing you to step away from calls to find a pen and paper (or just make coffee!).\n\nREJECTING UNWANTED CALLS\n\nOnce you've identified a call as unwanted, simply cover the mouthpiece and say to Alexa:\n\n\"Alexa, open Call Handler\"\n\"Alexa, ask Call Handler to take this\"\n\"Alexa, ask Call Handler to reject this call\"\n\nThen place your phone down beside your Alexa device and she'll take it from there.\n\nAlexa will happily take on the role of your personal assistant. She will politely - but firmly - reject the call. She sometimes plays some hold music as well. Finally, she will play a 'disconnected call' tone and make an additional announcements for very persistent callers.\n\nYou're welcome to stay and listen, or just walk away and make coffee. \n\nBut don't forget that Alexa has no fingers, so she can't hang up your phone for you - remember to come back and do that after a minute or two.\n\nPLAYING ON-HOLD MUSIC:\n\nCall Handler can also play music while you put your caller on hold, just like a professional phone system. So if you need to step away but plan to return to your call, you can say:\n\n\"Alexa, ask Call Handler to play hold music\"\n\nIf you don't like the first track, you can interrupt and say \"Alexa, play something else\". If you hear one you do like, you can save it as the default track by saying \"Alexa, remember this song\". The music tracks vary in length from 1-3 minutes, hopefully giving you just enough time to do what you need to before continuing the call. At the end of a track, Alexa will whisper a prompt, asking if you want more music. She whispers because your caller may be listening. Don't forget to pick up your call again!\n\nSTANDBY MODE\n\nYou can say \"Alexa, ask Call Handler to stay quiet\" to start the skill without prompts. It will play a low beep every ten seconds. Interrupt it by saying \"Alexa, take this call\". If you have an Echo Show or Spot, you can touch a button instead.\n\nONE-SHOT INVOCATIONS\n\nYou can ask Call Hander to just get started, without prompting by saying:\n\n\"Alexa, ask Call Handler to get rid of this caller\"\n\"Alexa, ask Call Handler to play hold music\"\n\"Alexa, tell Call Handler to disconnect\"\n\nDISPLAY DEVICES\n\n- On display devices like Echo Show and Spot, there are quick-access buttons for reject call, play hold music, help and stop.\n- While playing a call rejection message, tapping the button again chooses another message.\n- While playing hold music, tapping the button again selects another track at random.\n- While playing hold music, you can say \"Alexa, remember this track\", to save the current track as the default.\n- You can say Change voice to Brian, Amy, Matthew or Alexa, to save that voice as the default.\n- Say \"Alexa, clear settings\" to clear your saved music track and voice.\n\nUSER GUIDE\n\nCall Handler can email you its new User Guide to help you get even more out of this skill. The guide describes everything you can say to Call Handler in a bit more depth than the Help command.\nTo request it, just say \"send me the user guide\" at any prompt.\nIn order to send the email, Call Handler needs permission to access your email address and first name. Your email address is used to deliver the User Guide. Your name is used to personalise the message (\"Dear Alex\", not \"Dear Customer\"). This helps you and your email software to distinguish legitimate messages from spam.\nThe first time you request the User Guide, the skill will ask you to grant these two permissions using the Home screen in your Alexa app.\nOnce you have granted both permissions, just re-open the skill and ask for the User Guide again.\n\nFEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS\n\nThank you for your reviews in the Alexa app. Send any ideas and suggestions to alexa-call-handler AT laldy.com.\n\nCREDIT\n\nMusic: www.bensound.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
