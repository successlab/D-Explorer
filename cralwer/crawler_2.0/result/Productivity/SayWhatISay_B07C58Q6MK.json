This is subject to change.\n*Note: Due to the nature of voice and translation technology, translations may not always be accurate. Always check translations before using.\n\nChanging Accents:\nFor a list of accents, say \"list accents\".\nJust say \"change accent to\" followed by the name of an accent.\nAvailable Accents - Alexa, American male (1, 2), American female (1, 2, 3, 4), Australian male, Australian female, British male, British female (1, 2), French male, French female (1, 2, 3), German male, German female (1, 2), Indian female (1, 2), Italian male, Italian female (1, 2), Japanese male, Japanese female, Portuguese male, Portuguese female (1, 2), Spanish male (1, 2), Spanish female (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), boy, girl\n\nChanging Voice Modes:\nFor a list of voice modes, say \"list voice modes\".\nJust say \"say it again\", followed by the name of the voice mode.\nAvailable Voice Modes - fast, slow, high, low, backwards, rewind, whisper, beep, spelled out, robot, drunk, valley girl, random\n*Note: Whisper mode only works for certain voices.\n\nAlexa will also include her own random comments before reciting your phrase.
