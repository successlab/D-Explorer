To set up your phone, say \u201cAlexa, Find My Phone\u201d and you\u2019ll be asked for your cell number.\n\n2. To confirm it\u2019s really you, we\u2019ll send a 4-digit code via text message to your cell phone, that you can then provide to Alexa.\n\n3. That\u2019s it! You\u2019re all set up. Now when you\u2019ve lost your phone, simply say \u201cAlexa, Find My Phone.\u201d\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nThere are a limited number of calls available, but you can get more with Find My Phone Unlimited.\n\nTo add additional numbers, just say \u201cAlexa, ask Find My Phone to add a contact.\u201d\n\nOnly US and cell numbers will work in the US. We don\u2019t support landlines or other regions at this time.\n\nWe use five US-based outbound phone numbers. To ensure your phone will accept calls from these numbers, be sure to add them to your contacts: \n- 1.844.963.4389\n- 1.844.736.6490\n- 1.844.926.0163\n- 1.855.938.4817\n- 1.844.262.7102\n\nSome cell providers will block the number we call you from. To prevent this, open your device's settings, select Phone, and select \u201cBlocked Contacts.\u201d Unblock the numbers listed above.\n\nIf you are not receiving the code via text message, text \"un-stop\" to all four of the numbers listed above.\n\nWe do not sell your cell number to third-party companies.\n\nPlease understand that we need your support to keep this service running.\nLet us know if something is not working, by contacting: support@volleythat.com\n\nLIST OF COMMANDS\n\n- Alexa, Find My Phone.\n- Alexa, ask Find My Phone to add a contact.\n- Alexa, ask Find My Phone to call <contact name>.\n- Alexa, ask Find My Phone to delete a contact.\n- Alexa, ask Find My Phone to list contacts.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
