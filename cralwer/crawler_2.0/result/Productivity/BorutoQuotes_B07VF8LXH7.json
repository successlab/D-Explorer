This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: boruto quotes", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "Naruto never gives up!\nNaruto is inspiring because his character has become even more relatable, flawed, and human than ever. We love him for his flaws, not just despite them. For instance, Naruto is kind to a fault. He is persevering to a fault. He is loyal to a fault. But we love that about him. In the Shippuden arc, he deals with a ton of internal struggles. After Pein's defeat, Naruto became the famous hero of the Leaf. Fame means influence. And influence often surpasses physical power. Naruto's essential qualities (loyalty, ethics, & perseverance) & new-found fame make him respected among ninja worldwide. The only thing a true hero & leader can do, take responsibility for the shortcomings and evils of those he has vowed to protect. Ex: Naruto basically consents to let Guren (one of the Raikage's kunoichi) beat him to a pulp (maybe even to death, if that's what it would take to atone for Sasuke's sins). In this scene, Naruto truly becomes a hero. Naruto\u2019s nindo, his ninja way was to never give up. His dream was to be acknowledged by the people of the village who ignored and avoided him and to become the Hokage. Not once did Naruto loose sight of that dream, no matter what enemy came his way nor the circumstance, like when he lost one of his arms after his battle with Sasuke. He still pushed to be the hero and the Hokage and he achieved his goals. This has motivated me to never give up whenever things get hard for me\u2026.I've learned so much from the people who have never existed.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
