You'll learn ways to gain clarity and end the pain of being uncertain about your relationship. Staci provides a roadmap to face your fear of getting clear about what\u2019s really going on.\n\nStaci Bartley is an international Relationship Expert, and comes from a generation of messy/hard/treacherous relationships. Old paradigm agreements, unrealistic expectations, and shame for not being able to create long lasting relationships... Essentially she truly understood \"failing\" at love.\n\nBut after 30 + years, and lots of learning and adventures brought the realization that there is no such thing as failing at relationships, because each and every one you've been in, or will ever be in contributes to who you are, and who you are becoming. \n\nStaci will teach you how to discover and create what she calls \"toe tingling love.\" With her daily help, you'll build a partnership that is truly alive with love, intimacy, and a constant feeling of \"newlyweds.\"\n\nIt's time to throw out the old school, binding relationship expectations that kill love, and develop relationships that feel new. Love that turns you on again, and creates relationships that allow for our best life to come forth. We don't fail at relationships, we fail to learn the skills necessary for navigating them one daily dose at a time.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
