Many of us struggle to find even 1 minute of peace in our day, and this skill is for you.\n\nFor those who want a longer meditation, you can extend the meditation as many times as you would like. \n\nPracticing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However, this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one-minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1-minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
