In our day to day lives, we face problems that didn't even exist only a few generations ago. This leaves us exhausted, stressed and anxious. For emotional wellbeing, it is very important to unwind and relax from time to time - be it after a long day or after a short but very annoying morning commute. Mood Master helps you do just that. \n\nMood Master listens to and makes a note of how you're feeling. Mood Master helps you improve your mood by using various techniques. Sometimes, Mood Master forces you to express gratitude in face of anger. At other times, it tells you a joke (or many) to cheer you up. And if your device supports it, you may even be rewarded with some heartwarming pictures. \n\nMood Master is also a mood diary. It records your daily experiences in a notebook. It records not only your mood and feelings, but also your achievements. You can listen to them later by asking Mood Master to replay them. This allows you to observe your mood over a period of time. \n\nWhat are you waiting for! Go to your nearest Alexa device and \"talk to Mood Master\".", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
