Rather than create a list that may not be handy when you need it, What Should I Say lets you create a log of your favorite Skills and the phrases you commonly use with them. Then, you can always ask What Should I Say to list the phrases you use with any of the Skills you\u2019ve logged.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of how to use What Can I Say:\n1. First, you\u2019ll need to log one or more Skills by saying, \u201cAlexa, log a Skill\u201d for each Skill you wish to log. \n2. Then you will want to log the phrases you commonly use for those Skills. To do that you\u2019ll start your conversation by saying, \u201cAlexa, log a phrase.\u201d What Should I Say will help you log that phrase to the appropriate Skill.\n\nOnce you have logged Skills and their phrases you can:\n1. Get a list of your Skills. Say, \u201cAlexa, list my Skills.\u201d \n2. Get a list of your phrases for a logged Skill. Say, \u201cAlexa, list my phrases.\u201d You\u2019ll be given a numbered list of the Skills you logged and then be asked to indicate which Skill to use.
