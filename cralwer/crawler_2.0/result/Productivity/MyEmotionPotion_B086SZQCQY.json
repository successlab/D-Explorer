This skill will serve you a \"potion\" in the form quotes and bible verses based on the emotion you are experiencing. It sounds too simple to be useful, but sometimes it's just a different perspective, or the right combination of words that can help us survive our darkest days. \n\nCurrently, you can choose from these six emotions:\n\nAnger\nSadness\nAnxiety\nBitterness\nEnvy \nFear\n\nMost of the quotes are from people whose names you might recognize. You can choose to hear Bible verses from either the King James Bible or the easier to understand, New Living Translation.\n\nAt any time during the skill you can say, \"ALEXA, CHANGE EMOTION\", to choose a different emotion, or simply say, \"CHANGE EMOTION\", while Alexa is listening for a response.\n\nAt any time during the skill you can say, \"ALEXA, RESET\", to change your name or simply, \"RESET\", while Alexa is listening for a response.\n\nAt any time during the skill you can say, \"ALEXA, START OVER\", to start from the beginning or simply, \"START OVER\", while Alexa is listening for a response.\n\nPlease send your feedback to myemotionpotion@outlook.com\n\nThank you!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
