After a dinner time is set, anyone who would like to know what time dinner is can ask. \nFor example, if someone is planning on cooking dinner they can say \"Alexa, tell when's dinner that dinner is at 7:00 pm.\" Later in the day, say the kids come home from school, they can say \"Alexa, ask when's dinner what time is dinner.\" Alexa will respond with the saved dinner time.\nIf you don't plan on cooking dinner, simply say \"Alexa, tell when's dinner that there is no dinner tonight.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
