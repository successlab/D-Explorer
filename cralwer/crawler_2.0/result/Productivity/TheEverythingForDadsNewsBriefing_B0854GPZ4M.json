If you\u2019re answering \u2018Yes\u2019, to any of these you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nI take on everything from creating the relationships of your dreams, think: wife, husband, partner, son, daughter; to supercharged health and living in alignment, to business and brand building.\n\nMAYBE YOU'RE...\n\nSick and tired of the confusion over what being a man, and a father means, and what\u2019s being asked of you - the contradictions - be macho -be sensitive; be nurturing or be a disciplinarian; be the bread winner or be the man that puts family first. You simply want to feel good about yourself and find some balance in your life -- and feel a little overwhelmed by all the advice on the internet and are looking for fresh strategies to get impactful results.\n\nDoing great right now -- you\u2019re building a successful, pleasurable, balanced and meaningful life and lifestyle, as a man and a dad, but you want to improve and scale on what\u2019s working for you, and reach your highest potential.\n\nFeeling isolated, you like learning new perspectives and habits on being a man and a father, and gaining insights and creating real connections, you want to create a solid foundation that doesn\u2019t necessarily fit into a conventional box for all of your goals and dreams to be built on, and wish more people could relate to what you\u2019re trying to do. (Your family and friends are supportive, but don\u2019t quite \u201cget it\u201d).\n\nYou see, I passionately believe that you can achieve a balanced, meaningful and pleasurable life as a man, and as a dad,-- with healthy, loving relationships with your family, your friends, your community, AND be fulfilled pursuing what interests YOU, as well as doing good for the world.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
