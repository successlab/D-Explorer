This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: fridge buddy", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "Fridge Buddy helps to reduce food waste and save you time and money by keeping track of the expiry dates of the items in your fridge. \n\nOpen Fridge Buddy while you're putting your shopping away and tell it the name and expiry date of each item as you place it in the fridge. \nFridge Buddy will keep track of everything, so you'll never again need to rummage through the contents of your fridge to check expiry dates. \n\nYou can ask Fridge Buddy \"What needs using?\" or \"What needs using by Friday?\"\n\nYou can also ask \"What's in my fridge?\" for a full list of your fridge contents, or \"when does the cheese expire?\". \n\nWhen you use an item from your fridge, simply let Fridge Buddy know by saying \"Remove <food name>\" (or swipe it off the screen if you're using a visual device such as Echo Show). \n\nFridge Buddy will even help you with a Fridge clear-out. Ask \"What's expired\" for a list of what needs to go, and then \"Remove expired items\" when you're done. \n\nAsk Fridge Buddy to find you a recipe and it will search a database of thousands of recipes from around the world, based on the items in your fridge that need using up first. \n\nExample requests:\n\"Add cheese expiring July 12th\"\n\"Add milk July 14th\"\n\"Add yogurt\" \n\"What needs using\"\n\"What needs using by tomorrow/July 20th/Friday?\"\n\"Remove cheese\"\n\"What's expired?\"\n\"Remove expired items\"\n\"When does the cheese go off?\"\n\"Suggest some recipes\"\n\"Find recipes for cheese, mushrooms, and cream\"\n\nTips: \n* Open Fridge Buddy while unpacking your shopping, and use \"add...\" as you place each item in the fridge\n* When adding items, you can either say the food name and the date, or if you prefer a slower pace, just say the food name and Fridge Buddy will ask you for the date\n* You can usually omit the \"add\" and just say the food name, but if it's not recognized as a food, try saying \"add...\" \n* For a list of options, say \"Help\" at any time\n\nIf you're enjoying Fridge Buddy, please help us improve it by taking a second to add a review. \n\nIf you have any feedback (good or bad), questions, or suggestions for improvements/new features then we'd love to hear from you.
