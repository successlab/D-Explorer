This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: fish feeder", "reviewnum": " 35", "des": "Have you ever been unsure of when you last fed the fish? Do you share the fish feeding task with more than one family member and are unsure if somebody has already fed the fish?\n\nIf so, you can use this skill, Fish Feeder, to keep track of when you last fed the fish!\n\nNOTE: This is only a tracker skill. This skill does not actually feed the fish for you.\n\nEvery time you feed the fish, just say \"Alexa, tell Fish Feeder I fed the fish\". If it has been more than 24 hours since the fish were fed, Fish feeder will ask you if you are going to feed the fish. Fish feeder will record the time you feed the fish.\n\nIf you are not sure whether the fish have been fed, say \"Alexa, open Fish Feeder\". Fish feeder remembers when you last fed the fish. It will tell you how many minutes, hours, or days have passed since the fish were last fed.\n\nThis skill is useful with multiple family members, especially if you are in and out of the house during the day. As long as everyone in your household uses this skill, you will always be able to know if the fish have been fed.\n\nThis skill will work with multiple Alexa devices, as long as the devices are registered under the same Amazon account. You can also register under different accounts if you wish to keep track of separate fish.\n\nIf you are away from the house and have a house sitter that feeds your fish, you can keep track of when they last fed the fish. Whenever they use this skill, an entry will appear in your Alexa app.\n\nIf you find this skill useful, please leave this skill an honest review on the Alexa skills website or Alexa app. It would help us to promote this and other skills that we are working on.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, comments or questions, please email us at skillfeedback@gmail.com", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
