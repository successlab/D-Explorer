Ask Alexa to remember where you are leaving your keys (or other stuff). And when you forget just ask Alexa.\n\nSample Invocations: \n\"Alexa, open sharp memory\",\n\"Alexa, ask sharp memory to remember my wallet is on desk\", \n\"Alexa, ask sharp memory to remember my key is in jeans\",\n\"Alexa, ask sharp memory to remember that my car is in alley\",\n\"Alexa, ask sharp memory where is car\",\n\"Alexa, ask sharp memory where is my wallet\".\n\n\nIn v1.0, skill can recognize if you are asking to remember about \n1. Leaving stuff somewhere like \"keys are on desk\", \"car is in alley\", \"wallet is in my jeans\" \n2. Appointment or events like \"doctor's appointment is on 4th January\", \"my wife's birthday is on 3rd December\" etc.\n(If you want some other missing feature, let me know in comments)\n\nSkill forgets the entry once you have asked. So you can't ask again. \n\nIf skill can't find the exact match in memory then it may remind you about something that it thinks you might want to know. e.g. You asked Alexa to remember your \"BMW car key\" is in your pocket. But later you ask about your \"car key\", skill will first try to find if it remembers about \"car key\", if it doesn't then it will tell you about \"BMW car key\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
