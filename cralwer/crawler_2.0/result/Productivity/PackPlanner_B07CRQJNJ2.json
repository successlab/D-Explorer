To get started, say \"Alexa, open Pack Planner\". For any location specified, you can store two lists: one that repeats weekly and one that does not. \n\nTo make a repeating list, say, for example, \"Remind me to bring my Spanish textbook to school every Wednesday\". Now, on every Wednesday, Pack Planner will remind you to bring your Spanish textbook to school.\n\nTo make a non-repeating list, say \"Remind me to bring my gym clothes to work on Monday\". Pack Planner will then know to only remind you to bring your gym clothes on Monday, and will not remind you again. \n\nThe main difference between creating a repeating and non-repeating list is whether or not the word \"every\" is used. If you say \"every Thursday\", Pack Planner will create a repeating list. Just saying \"Thursday\" will create a non-repeating list. Words and phrases such as \"today\", \"tomorrow\", and \"next Friday\" will always create a non-repeating list.\n\nTo have Pack Planner tell you what to bring on a specific day, simply say \"Alexa, ask Pack Planner what I should bring to (location) on (day)\". For the day, you can say a weekday, or phrases such as \"today\", \"tomorrow\", \u201cthis Saturday\u201d, or \"next Wednesday\".\nTo delete an item from a list, say \"Alexa, tell pack planner to delete (item) from my (location) list for (day)\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
