Currently, the assistant is focused on providing restriction enzyme-based information, such as cutsite, recommended buffer, need for supplements, double digest conditions, requirement for 2-site cleavage, etc. The \u201ctell me about\u201d feature summarizes what you should know about any NEB restriction enzyme. Many functionalities of NEBiocalculator are also available, including molarity, ligation, and dilution calculations. Lastly, you can request to hear NEB Podcasts, ask for quick tips and tricks for cloning, and have access to a lab timer.\n\nFunctionality will continually be added \u2013  Visit www.neb.com/myNEB for the updated list of functionalities available, as well as suggested prompts.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
