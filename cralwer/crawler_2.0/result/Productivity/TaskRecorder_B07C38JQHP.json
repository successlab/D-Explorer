For example, you tell Alexa when a task that you want to track has been completed, like, I tested my insulin levels, mowed the lawn, changed the furnace filter, or replaced my toothbrush. Later, you can ask her what your last task was, or when you last completed a particular task, and she will give you an answer: \"tested your insulin levels was recorded 3 hours and 46 minutes ago,\" or \"mowed the lawn was recorded 10 days and 4 hours ago.\" This skill works most naturally when you record tasks in past tense. Your recorded tasks are stored in an Alexa List and are editable in the Alexa app.\n\nIcon made by Freepik from http://www.flaticon.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
