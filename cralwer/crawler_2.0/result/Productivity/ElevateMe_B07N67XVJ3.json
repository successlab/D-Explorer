If you only have 10 minutes it's not helpful when the internet suggests that going for a run would heighten our mood. Elevate Me asks you four questions to determine your needs and then suggests an activity which fits your energy level, your mood and your time preferences. The suggestions are based on interventions which the science of positive psychology has found to be effective.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
