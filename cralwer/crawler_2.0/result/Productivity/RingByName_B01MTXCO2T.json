With this skill you can ask RingByName to initiate a call to any telephone number or extension. You can even call a stored contact by simply saying their name. Alexa will have RingByName call your phone number and connect you to the number or person requested as soon as you answer your phone. To use this skill, link your account in the Alexa app and then ask RingByName to call a phone number or a stored contact. \n\nAlexa devices are not currently capable of acting as a speakerphone but work to launch calls from your RingByName system. This skill is currently only available to RingByName subscribers -- for more information go to www.ringbyname.com/alexa.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
