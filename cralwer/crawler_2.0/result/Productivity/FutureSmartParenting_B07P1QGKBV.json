Technology promises a potential bright future but equally threatens jobs. What worked before is not going to provide the solutions for going forward.\n\nAs parents, it can be unsettling to try and help our children think through the big questions of the school years: what should they study, what should they be when they grow up, what new skills are required to be successful and what will success even look like a few years from now?\n\nWe'll highlight key areas that parents and schools need to address in order to ensure our children are ready for whatever the future might throw at them. \n\nGraeme will cover the issues of a changing world, changing views of careers and jobs, new skills we need to learn and teach, and the changing roles of parents and teachers.  \n\nJoin futurist, author & parent, Graeme Codrington and his team as they present a compelling vision of the future of work, and shares insights into what we must do to help our children prepare for it.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
