What fires you up to achieve your business and personal goals for the day, the week, the month?\n\nMy \"spark\" is curiosity. My curiosity drives me to learn, solve problems and explore new possibilities. I road trip all across the country exploring new places, meeting new people, and discovering new opportunities. I am a digital educator and road trip explorer. There is unlimited inspiration along the journey to spark new ideas and conversations, and I would love to share some of those with you.\n\nWhat is the \"spark\" that ignites your curiosity, your thoughts, your actions? Every day I will throw a spark to the wind and see if it catches fire for you. These sparks may be an anecdote, a trending topic, a tip, or a tool that might be just the right catalyst to light your fire and move you forward faster, stronger, and with more intention.\n\nSo join me daily, and let's light that fire with \"The Daily Spark\" .", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
