Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance, now you can do this via your Flash Briefing. \n\nMany people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However, this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused the full length of time. \n\nPlease make this part of your Flash Briefing and leave us a review!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
