With the Domino\u2019s skill, you can build a new order from scratch, place your Easy Order or your most recent order. You can ask Alexa for your order\u2019s status with Domino\u2019s Tracker\u00ae. Available only for orders placed in the U.S.\n\nTo get started, just say \u201cAlexa, open Domino\u2019s.\u201d Alexa will connect you to Domino\u2019s and get you ordering and tracking in no time.\n\nTo re-order a saved order, make sure you have a Domino\u2019s Pizza Profile. If you don\u2019t have a Pizza Profile, set one up at www.dominos.com. You\u2019ll also need an Easy Order or a recent order saved within your Pizza Profile. Once you\u2019ve placed your order, you can ask Alexa for Domino\u2019s Tracker\u00ae updates at each stage, from the time it\u2019s placed to when it\u2019s ready for delivery or pickup. You can also sign up for Tracker Notifications for real-time updates. Alexa will simply use the phone number saved in your Pizza Profile.\n\nTo place an order without linking your Domino\u2019s Pizza Profile we\u2019ll only need your email address, please go to the skill\u2019s settings and grant \"Email Address\" permissions. If you want to make it easier to place an order you can also grant us \u201cDevice Address\u201d to find your nearest store, \u201cMobile Number\u201d so we can reach you if we need more information, \u201cFull Name\u201d so we know who this order is for and \u201cAlexa Notifications\u201d if you want us to let you know when your pizza is ready!\n\nIf you just want to track your carryout or delivery order from Domino\u2019s, enter the phone number you used with a recent order into the app. Alexa will give you the current status of your order whenever you ask.
