This (INOFFICIAL!) App will pull beer ratings from ratebeer.com, one of the most-visited resources for beer information. You can get the average rating of your beer by saying \"Alexa, ask rate beer for <beername> rating\" (See example Phrases! Please note that you need to invoke RateBeer - meaning you have to either use the first example or start a session using the second). Be as precise with your beer as possible, as the skill will return the first match. Also please note that numbers are not currently supported.\n\nFuture updates are planned:\n- Images of the bottles in the companion app\n- Suggestions if a beer can not be found\n- Let Alexa read out the latest ratings\n- Obtain background information on a beer\n- Support for numbers in Beer names (e.g. \"Beck's 1873 Pils\")\n\nIcon design by Onlyyouqj / Freepik.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
