Use Wine Cooler to ensure you bring out the best flavors and aromas in your next glass and enjoy the perfect balance of tannins to fruit and alcohol!\n\nThe misconception that red wine should be served at \"room temperature\" stems from the medieval days of castles and cellars, where chilly rooms never warmed up to modern levels. So next time you go to pour a wine, be sure to give it the proper chill first.\n\nTemperatures are reported in Fahrenheit.
