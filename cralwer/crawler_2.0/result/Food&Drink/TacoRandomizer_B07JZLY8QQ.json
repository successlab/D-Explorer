Have your tacos become dull and boring because you keep ordering the same old taco? If you need some taco-spiration let Taco Randomizer suggest a taco for you! Just say, \"Alexa, ask Taco Randomizer to make a taco.\"\n\nAlexa will build you a custom taco from a variety of ingredients. Will it be a soft taco, a crunchy taco, or maybe a crunchy taco wrapped in a soft taco? Will your taco have chicken, carne asada, carnitas, or seasoned ground beef? How about some cheese, onions, cilantro, or even bacon and barbeque sauce? Or, maybe something a bit unconventional like shredded kale, crushed tortilla chips, or cole slaw? You never know, the results might be delicious! \n\nPro tip: Add a squeeze of lime and some hot sauce to your taco for a delectable meal!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
