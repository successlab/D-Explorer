Play Burrito Roulette and let Alexa build a custom burrito for you! Just say, \"Alexa, ask Burrito Roulette to make a burrito.\"\n\nAlexa will build you a custom burrito from a variety of meats (or veggies), different types of rices and beans, different types of salsas, guacamole and other ingredients. Then, to make it easy for you to tell the restaurant what you want, Alexa will send a card to your Alexa App with all of the ingredients.\n\nIngredients that Alexa will randomly select from include:\nMeat: Chicken, carnitas, steak, barbacoa or veggies.\nRice: White or brown rice.\nBeans: Pinto or black beans.\nSalsa: Mild, medium, hot or corn salsa.\nOther: Sour cream, cheese, guacamole and lettuce.\n\nThe fun is in the randomness of the ingredients that Alexa suggests. Every burrito will include a random meat (or veggies). The other ingredients are then randomly selected to build your burrito.", "priv": ""}
