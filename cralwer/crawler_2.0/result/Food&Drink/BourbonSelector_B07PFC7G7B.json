Our goal is to create a tool to help you select the best bourbon or whiskey that suits your needs and maximizes your tasting experience. This skill will ask you to choose a \"wheated bourbon\", \"traditional bourbon\", or a \"rye bourbon\" and then a specific bottle is selected for you. Each selection will give you the distiller or producer, the mash bill, the price tier, the proof, and other information about the selection. Enjoy!\n\nwww.BourbonSelector.com", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
