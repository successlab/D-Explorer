This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: sous chef\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 127", "des": "This skill allows you to interact with ANY recipe (even your grandma's peach cobbler recipe) using your voice. Simply use the Sous Chef Recipes App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play to enter your recipes. Then use your Amazon Alexa enabled device to interact with your recipes in a natural way.\n\nOnce you've linked your email address to the app and this skill the first thing you'll want to do is add a recipe. The app allows you to easily load recipes from the most popular food websites. Note some websites may require their own login. You can also load recipes from smaller websites like blogs or enter your own recipes manually as well. By popular demand you can now also enter recipes with any web browser at https://souschef.recipes/app/www/index.html\n\nOnce you've added a recipe you'll need to go shopping. The companion app has a built in shopping list which allows you to select the ingredients you'll need for each recipe. You can type in other shopping items as well or you can add them with your Alexa device:\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to add sour cream to my shopping list.\u201d\n\nWhen you're ready to begin making your recipe you'll want to open it first. You can do this in the app or you can simply ask Alexa to do it for you:\n\n\"Alexa tell Sous Chef to open the burger sauce recipe.\"\n\nHint: Sous is a French word that sounds like the English name Sue.\n\nYou can also check which recipe you have open.\n\n\u201cAlexa ask Sous Chef what my current recipe is.\u201d\n\nOnce your recipe is open you'll be able to interact with the ingredients. Here are some examples of things you can say:\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to list ingredients.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa ask Sous Chef how much baking powder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa ask Sous Chef how many potatoes.\u201d\n\nHint: if Alexa doesn't find what you're looking for but you know it's there use the app to simplify the text. For example you might change \u201c\u00bc cup (4 oz) unsalted butter melted and cooled\u201d to \u201c4 ounces unsalted butter\u201d.\n\nNext you'll want to go through the steps of the recipe. For example you can use the following commands:\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to go to the first step.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to go to the previous step.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to go to the next step.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to go to the fourth step.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to repeat step.\u201d\n\nHint: while Alexa is talking you can say \u201cAlexa stop\u201d at any time. Unfortunately at this time you can't resume from where you left off but hopefully that is a feature we can add in the near future.\n\nRecipes in the Sous Chef App also have a description and notes. You can access these by asking Alexa to read them aloud:\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to read the description.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa tell Sous Chef to read notes.\u201d\n\nHint: Sous Chef will get better at recognizing your recipes over time. The more recipes that are added the more text we'll have to analyze to improve our speech recognition models.\n\nThat's all there is to it, hands free recipe access at your command. It's like having your own personal assistant in the kitchen. With all of Alexa's other great cooking features like timers and measurement conversions you'll be cooking with ease in no time.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or ideas about new features, please don't hesitate to contact us via the app or by emailing help@souschef.recipes. Also be sure to check out the helpful \u201cHow To\u201d videos available in the app or by visiting http://souschef.recipes. \n\nSavour!\nSous Chef", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
