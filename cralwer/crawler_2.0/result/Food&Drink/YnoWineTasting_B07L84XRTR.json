Seriously, the best way to learn about wine is to compare them in the blind. The wine world is awash with experts, clubs, and gimmicks designed to tell you what to drink. The Yno Wine Tasting platform was designed by a wine educator who believes every wine lover is different. With Yno, tasters can plan and host tasting events, invite their friends, record ratings and comments, and store the results. Yno tasters learn more about what they like with each tasting, all the while building a personal library of favorites.\n\nNormally, blind wine tastings require laboriously filling out tasting sheets for each wine. The Yno Tasting platform removes the paperwork by allowing tasters to use their mobile devices. However, Alexa frees up both hands! Simply link your Yno Wine Tasting and Alexa accounts and tell Alexa to \"open wine tasting\" to link to your live tasting event. After that your guests can use Alexa to add their ratings, comments, or get current stats without ever having to let go of their glass.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
