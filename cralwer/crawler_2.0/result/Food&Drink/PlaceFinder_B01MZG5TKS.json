No need to repeat the same information. E.g. you said \"Search for an Indian buffet In downtown Seattle\" and decided to search the same in Everett, WA, just say \"Search In Everett Washington\" instead of saying \"Search for an Indian buffet In Everett Washington\". Same applies to both location and search term (\"e.g. Search for Chinese buffet\" if you want to search in same location). Location and a search term preserved until you end the session with Place Finder.\n\nDo advanced search!\nTry \"Search for a cheap open Indian buffet Near 94040\" will search for $ and $$ price Indian buffets near 94040 zip code.\nYou can also try \"Search for a cheap sushi In North Raleigh\" or \"Search for a open burger place In Sunnyvale California\".\nOr try \"Search for seafood markets Near downtown Seattle Sort by rating\" which sounds self explanatory.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
