Looking for a lunch recommendation? Then open Jet City Guide and say \"lunch\" to hear about one of Jake's favorite spots for a sandwich or maybe a burger. If you want to hear about some sight-seeing options, just say \"recommend an attraction\" to hear some good places to visit while you're in town. And since rain is always a possibility here, better make sure to say \"go outside\" to get a quick weather update.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
