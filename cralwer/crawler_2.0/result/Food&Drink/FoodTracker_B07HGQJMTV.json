The suggested food or recipe will be using the food you have listed. If you mark a food as a condiment, I will not suggest the food. You can also ask me what's old, and I will list out the top ten oldest food, that way you can remember to eat your leftovers instead of throwing them out. \n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n- Add food (a more conversational way to add food with me)\n- Undo addition (Did you misspeak? Did Alexa not hear you right? This will remove the most recent food addition)\n- Add milk and eggs to the fridge middle shelf\n- Add milk to the fridge top shelf (can also say bottom drawer/top drawer/second drawer/anything else)\n- Move milk to the fridge middle shelf\n- Do I have milk?\n- What's in the fridge?\n- What should I eat?
