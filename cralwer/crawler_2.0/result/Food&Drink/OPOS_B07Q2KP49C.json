All OPOS recipes use One Pot and all cooking is done at One Shot. No steps. No supervision. From Pastas to Paneer Makhni, Malai Kofta to Mysorepak, OPOS recipes are easier and faster than cooking instant noodles!\n\nOPOS Story\n---------------------\n15 years back, a small group of people in Chennai sought to redefine cooking with science. They discussed curries, heat transfer, flavoring, textures and chemical reactions in cooking. They sought to harness advances in science to empower anyone, anywhere, anytime to cook better.\n\nThese discussions happened at various food forums, beach cookouts and at occasional workshops. Soon, this style of cooking had its own kit. Measuring cups and scales, pressure cooker, induction stove. New pantry staples were proposed: Bottled tadka, dehydrated dal, caramelized onion and tomato, curry bases.\n\nLayering, Attalysis, Controlled caramelization, Pressure Baking. All these techniques could be written on a single sheet of paper but were powerful enough to rewrite world cuisines.\n\nThese techniques led to the rise of a whole new class of home kitchens. They empowered a whole generation of home cooks to reinvent traditional recipes. They put the fun back into cooking at home. More importantly, they empowered anyone, anywhere, anytime to cook great food, almost instantly. These techniques intensified natural tastes, colors, textures and flavors. OPOS was born! Soon, it swept across India, US, Singapore, UK & Australia, unchaining thousands from the kitchen.\n\nButterfly, one of India\u2019s premier kitchen equipment manufacturers, stepped in to make appliances specifically designed for OPOS. The MagicPot was born.\n\nOPOS Mission\n-----------------\nThe way we cook now is unsustainable. We waste far too much water, fuel, food and labour. Most of us rely on someone else to feed us. This is not sustainable. We are on a mission to ensure anyone, anywhere, anytime, has access to clean, green, healthy, tasty food. In minutes. We will continuously innovate equipment and techniques to make it happen. We want to ensure blood, sweat or tears have no place in the kitchen.\n\nExample Phrases\n--------------------\nBelow are the sample phrases that you can use to interact with OPOS Alexa Skill:\n1.
