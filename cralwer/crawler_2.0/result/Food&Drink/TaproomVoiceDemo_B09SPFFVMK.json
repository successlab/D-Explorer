Asking for Beer menu will list the available beers served at the taproom. It also enables users to check the latest additions to the menu and filter beers by style. The Food truck option provides updates on the food trucks scheduled to pull up at the bar through the week. And the Events feature gives details of the exciting occasions and activities slated to be held in the upcoming days at the taproom. \nOnce you\u2019ve enabled the app on your Alexa device, just say Alexa, open Taproom Voice Demo. Then you can use any of the following commands:\n\nTo get a list of available beers, say:\nBeer menu\nWhat beers are available?\n\nTo know about the food truck schedule, say:\nFood truck\nWhich food truck is scheduled for Tuesday?\nWhich food truck is at the bar tonight?\n\nTo look for upcoming events, say:\nEvents\nWhat events are happening at the bar tonight?\n\nTo check your preferred style of beer:\nWhat Sours are on the menu?\nDo you have Lagers on the menu?\n\nTo check the latest beer releases:\nWhat\u2019s new on the menu?", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
