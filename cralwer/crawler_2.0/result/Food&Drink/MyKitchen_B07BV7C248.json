She always has a stock response, but it's not really an actionable answer, unless I want to order pizza every night. (Shout out to the Domino's skill.) And recipe skills are too complicated over voice--the search functionality and deliverance method just isn't optimized for Alexa yet. I needed a skill that would just get me started. \"Beef arrabiata with spaghetti.\" \"Sesame ginger chicken.\" Sounds great, Alexa, thanks for reminding me. There's about 20 of them and I'll add anything with suggestions! This is my very first skill, so it's a simple one-time interaction model right now. I'm hoping to add a feature that allows you to pull from your OWN database, or, maybe in the far future, refine her suggestions based on what's in your fridge. In the near future, I'd like a feature that ensures that you won't be given the same suggestion twice in at least two weeks.And, just maybe, list sides and proteins separately and mix them up FOR you. I will absolutely take requests, comments, inputs, and dinner win/fail stories!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
