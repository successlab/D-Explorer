Clear Ice doesn't have air bubbles, making it totally transparent, and perfect for very special cocktails. Feel free to run a web search via your favorite search engine for: \"clear ice\".\n\nTo get started you should first set your time zone. The default time zone is Eastern. You can change the current time zone at any time by saying [Alexa, tell my freezer set time zone to pacific]. The Time zones currently supported are [Eastern, Central, Mountain, Mountain Standard, Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii).\n\nThe \"my freezer\" skill provides the ability to calculate when your clear ice will be ready. The built in Alexa timer function is limited to a maximum of 24 hours. The typical time it takes to make clear ice can easily exceed this 24 hour limitation. The clear ice freeze time is set to a default of 28 hours. This setting can be adjusted at any time by saying [Alexa, tell my freezer to set clear ice freeze time to 26 hours.]. The time value will vary depending on the product you use, and your freezer temperature settings. Feel free to adjust this freeze time setting to your specific needs.\n\nWhen you start your clear ice say [Alexa, tell my freezer that I started the clear ice]. This will set the start date/time of when you started. If you don't want the current date/time, you can also say [Alexa, tell my freezer that I started the clear ice at 2 pm] or [Alexa, tell my freezer that I started the clear ice at 2 pm yesterday] or [Alexa, tell my freezer I started the clear ice 20 minutes ago].\n\nOnce you have started your clear ice, you can ask when it will be ready by saying [Alexa, ask my freezer when will the clear ice be ready]. Alexa will calculate the estimated finish time based on when you started, the current freeze time setting, and the current time zone.\n\nPlease note: You will not be notified when the clear ice is ready, but you can say [Alexa, ask my freezer when will the clear ice be ready] at any time.\n\nI Hope you find this skill useful. \n\nDave M.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
