It is a competition, but you'll have fun even if you come in last. Each person has to make their own dish and bring their own pairing wine.\nDishes are bite size for each participant and are served one at a time with its pairing wine.\nThe host will send a calendar invite at least two weeks before the event with a recap of the last episode, the big announcement of the rule of the next meet and ideally a joke.\nThe day of, the host will set a long table with some fun decorations, full dinner set and of course, two wine glasses on each seat for whites and reds.\nWhen all your foodie friends have arrived, they will announce what they brought and a lineup will be set to progress from appetizers to dessert. They will now present their dishes and wine one at a time.\nOven should stay warm and contestants can put their dishes in at any time to be prepared for their turn. They are welcome to use the microwave or the fridge as well.\nFor each participant, no food can be tasted until everyone has both food and wine, at which point everyone should cheer.\nAfter all dishes have been tasted, foodies will vote on their favorite wine, food and paring.\nPairing will take the trophy home and should be voted for first, second and third place in that category getting four, two and one points respectively.\nWinner of the pairing category gets to come without bringing anything next time and gets to set a rule for the next meet.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
