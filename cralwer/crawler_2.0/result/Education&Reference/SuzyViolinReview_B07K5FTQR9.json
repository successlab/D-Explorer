This skill is intended to help students review all of their recent songs rather than playing the same few songs over and over. \n\nTo start, you first need to tell which song you are currently learning. You can do this by saying \"Alexa, tell Suzy Violin that I am currently learning {name of song}\" or \"Alexa, tell Suzy Violin that I am on {name of song}\". After that you can ask for a song to review by saying \"Alexa, ask Suzy Violin for a song\". \n\n When you pass off your current song and move to the next you can say \"Alexa, tell Suzy Violin I passed off my current song\" or \"Alexa, tell Suzy Violin I am on the next piece\" rather than having to say the name of the song. \n\nThe name of many songs in the various books are very similar. For example there is a \"Bouree\" song in book 2 and one in book 3. If you are on the Bouree song in book 2 you can use the name \"Bouree book two\" or \"Handel Bouree\". Likewise, if you are on the Bouree song in book 3 you could use the name \"Bouree book three\" or \"Bach Bouree\" \n\nPlease note that there are currently only the first 5 books available. If you would like to use this skill, but are past book 5 then please leave a positive review with a note that you would like more books added. Likewise, the skill is currently setup for single person use only. If there are multiple students in your household then each student will have to tell which song they are on every time they use the skill. If you have multiple students in your household that want to use the skill, but don't want to say the name of their current song each time, then please leave a corresponing comment in your review. \n\nA future enhancement to the skill could be having the ability to play the first 5-10 seconds of the selected review song to help the student remember how the piece sounds. If this is something that would help you please state so in your review. Here are the names of the various songs in each book. \n\nBook 1\n\n----------\n\n1.
