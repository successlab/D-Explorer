All you have to do is tell Alexa to \"open computer science wiki\", and then ask away. You can say \"Alexa, what is the definition of a while loop?\" or \"Alexa, what is an interface?\", and she will give you a concise, helpful explanation of the word. This can be helpful while studying if you forget what a specific piece of syntax means, or if you just want to brush up on your fundamentals before heading to an interview.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
