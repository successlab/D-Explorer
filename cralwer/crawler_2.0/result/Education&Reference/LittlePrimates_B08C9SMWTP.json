The long procession with a black coffin, the biological sciences are being buried and the autopsy revealed, an outdated, evidence based science of anthropomorphism. Enter computer education, simulations and the cyber-physica, suddenly biology is no more. Listen to this touching story of a little monkey you name, torn from his family, with a monkey casualty running to tens and hundreds as tribes are massacred for a few simian siblings, is it worth it, you may ask. The answer is a resounding No!, maybe you should join this funeral procession, learning the newer computational sciences and robotics. Machine evolution is indeed distinct from natural evolution and medicine is of course timeless.\n At any point, you can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit the skill.
