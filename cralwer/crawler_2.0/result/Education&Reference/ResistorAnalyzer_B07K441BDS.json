This skill lets you quickly and easily learn the resistance of resistors with 3-6 color bands on them, and also provides tolerance and temperature coefficient data (on 4-6 color band resistors). Even helps correct the common mistake of reading resistors backwards on common resistor values.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
