We participate in the First Lego League competition in the fall season, which comprises of 10 students per team with 2 coaches. In the spring, we participate in the General Motors competition, which comprises of 5 students per team with one coach per team. The number of teams available determines on how many parent or grandparent volunteers we have for the year.
