Just sit back and listen. Alexa brings the Bible alive.\n\nWhat would the KJV be like if its translators could use today's technology and today's words? The answer is Today's King James Version (taken from the Breakthrough KJV). It was translated from the Textus Receptus (the Greek text closest to the King James Version) in today's words with the help of today's advanced tools to produce a high definition Bible that is easy-to-understand.\n\nEven if you never go to church, you won't have a problem understanding this Bible.\n\nThis High Definition Bible in today's everyday words is much more accurate to the Greek text than the low resolution Bibles of yesteryear.\n\nStart with John 1 (just say, \"Start\" after Today's King James Version starts). When Alexa is finished with it, say Next, and she will go to the next chapter. You can go all the way through the New Testament like this.\n\nToday's King James Version also features a daily chapter from the Bible (just say Daily).\n\nDiscover God's message and instructions for you from the comfort of your home.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
