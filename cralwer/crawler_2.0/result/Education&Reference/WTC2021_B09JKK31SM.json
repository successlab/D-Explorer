The presentation is on complexity models for neural networks with Tensor Decomposition representations and compression techniques, in the framework of Z Completeness, a concept invented by the author to denote the possibility of tensorization of network architecture. In this talk we explore the limits of tensorization in the realms of data mining, supervised and unsupervised learning, and review tensor compression techniques, towards less computationally intensive tensor forms.\nEmail the author at coderdojostpaul2@gmail.com with any QnA's", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
