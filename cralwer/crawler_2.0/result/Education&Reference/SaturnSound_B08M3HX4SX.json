Loaded with an array of powerful instruments and cameras, the spacecraft was capable of taking accurate measurements and detailed images in a variety of atmospheric conditions and light spectra.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched with two elements: the Cassini orbiter and the Huygens probe. Cassini-Huygens reached Saturn and its moons in July 2004, beaming home valuable data that transformed our understanding of the Saturnian system. Huygens entered the murky atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's biggest moon, and descended via parachute onto its surface - the most distant spacecraft landing to date.\n\nCassini-Huygens was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft equipped for 27 diverse science investigations. The Cassini orbiter had 12 instruments and the Huygens probe had six. Equipped to thoroughly investigate all the important elements that the Saturn system may uncover, many of the instruments had multiple functions. The spacecraft communicated through one high-gain and two-low gain antennas. It was only in the event of a power failure or other such emergency situation, however, that the spacecraft communicated through one of its low-gain antennas.\n\nThree Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators \u2013 commonly referred to as RTGs \u2013 provided power for the spacecraft, including the instruments, computers, and radio transmitters on board, attitude thrusters, and reaction wheels.\nn some ways, the Cassini spacecraft had senses better than our own. For example, Cassini could \"see\" in wavelengths of light and energy that the human eye cannot. The instruments on the spacecraft could \"feel\" things about magnetic fields and tiny dust particles that no human hand could detect.\n\nThe science instruments can be classified in a way that can be compared to how human senses operate. Your eyes and ears are \"remote sensing\" devices because you can receive information from remote objects without being in direct contact with them. Your senses of touch and taste are \"direct sensing\" devices. Your nose can be construed as either a remote or direct sensing device. You can certainly smell the apple pie across the room without having your nose in direct contact with it, but the molecules carrying the scent do have to make direct contact with your sinuses. Cassini's instruments can be classified as remote and microwave remote sensing instruments, and fields and particles instruments \u2013 these were all designed to record significant data and take a variety of close-up measurements.\n\nThe remote sensing instruments on the Cassini Spacecraft calculated measurements from a great distance. This set included both optical and microwave sensing instruments including cameras, spectrometers, radar and radio.\n\nThe fields and particles instruments took \"in situ\" (on site) direct sensing measurements of the environment around the spacecraft. These instruments measured magnetic fields, mass, electrical charges and densities of atomic particles. They also measured the quantity and composition of dust particles, the strengths of plasma (electrically charged gas), and radio waves.\n\nThe Cassini spacecraft has been detecting intense radio emissions from the planet Saturn. They come from the planet's aurorae, where magnetic field lines thread the polar regions. These signals have been shifted into the range of human hearing and compressed in time.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
