Our family members are those persons to whom we are related by blood. People of one family usually share the place they live in; they share their surnames. A major chunk of time of their lives is shared with each other as well. Family unit is very important to people as it is the basic tool that shapes you as a person. Your personality development is very much dependent upon it. If a person has seen a secure family life with lots of love and affection, he or she will be more aggressive and positively driven towards life. Your family is the group of people you can rust the most. These are the people who add meaning to your life. A person can survive through very tough times if he or she has a supportive family.
