This show features amazing characters and powerful women who rose above their environments to become legends.\n\n - About the Annie Oakley Books - \n\nSet in the late 1800\u2019s, these historical fiction books portray the iconic female sharpshooter as an amateur sleuth, and follows her adventures with the Wild West Show at home and abroad.\n\nBovee\u2019s exciting debut, Girl with a Gun, was released in June, 2018 and was a finalist in the Next Generation Indie Book Awards for Historical Fiction Books and the winner of the 2019 Hillerman Southwest Fiction Award. \n\nIts prequel novella, Shoot Like a Girl, followed in September, 2018. \n\nThe second book in the series, Peccadillo at the Palace, was released in May 2019. Folly at the Fair will be released in 2020.\n\n\u201cAbsorbing, heartfelt, and thrilling, Girl with a Gun shows off young Annie Oakley\u2019s skills as a sharpshooter and as a loyal detective. From the period details to the Wild West setting, I was completely immersed in the story and in the larger-than-life characters. Like Annie herself, Bovee\u2019s prose sparkles with precision and skill.\u201d \u2013 Martha Conway \u2013 Author of The Underground River, New York Times Book Review Editor\u2019s Choice.\n\n- From The Host -\n\nIt is so fun for me to take the spark of an idea and grow it into full-length book of mystery and intrigue, usually in a historical setting. The spark for my historical fiction books often comes from something or someone in history that moves me or makes me think about how people in the past might have thought about or reacted to a mystery in their life.\n\nI love to write about empowered women in history, horses, unconventional characters, and real-life historical events. I want readers to experience the joy of an escape from their everyday lives into a mystery from the past.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m working on two historical fiction series and a stand-alone novel about empowered women in history (some from real life, and some made-up), and I have been honored to receive some awards for some of these historical fiction books. My novel Grace in the Wings is currently a Semi-Finalist in the 2019 Chanticleer Chatelaine and Goethe Awards. Winners will be announced in the Fall of 2020. Peccadillo at the Palace, the second novel in the Annie Oakley series was a finalist in the Best Book Awards. In 2019 I was honored as a finalist in the Next Generation Indie Awards for Girl with a Gun, the first book in the Annie Oakley Series. The book also won first place in the New Mexico/Arizona Book Awards contest in the Mystery Crime category, and also won overall with the Hillerman Southwest Fiction Award.\n\nIn addition to my passions for writing historical fiction books and my family, I am an avid horsewoman. I train my own horses and have competed at the local, regional, and national levels in Dressage, Sport Horse, Western Dressage, and Western Trail. Always interested in improving my horsemanship skills and my relationships with my horses, I study and practice natural horsemanship with the Parelli Program. I am currently on hiatus from competition, but enjoy playing with and riding my four horses several times a week.\n\nMy husband, Kevin, and I live in the beautiful Land of Enchantment, New Mexico. We own a beautiful horse property nestled along the Rio Grande where we live with our four dogs, and four horses. We also have a place in Hawaii and try to get there as often as possible!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
