Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or emptiness. These are only some of the signs that indicate you may be suffering from what is called \u201cclinical depression.\u201d As these symptoms persist, the negative views may eventually lead a person to feel like giving up. \n\nIt is important to realize that these feelings of negativity are only part of the depression and are not typically an accurate reflection of the actual situation. As treatment begins, these negative feelings fade.\n\nThe important thing to remember here is patience. You may be taking antidepressant medications or undergoing therapy or any combination of both and you may be getting better. However, do not make the mistake of expecting that your mood would immediately turn for the better.\n\n Most likely, the change would be gradual, nothing drastic. At first, the change might even seem imperceptible but as time passes, you will notice that you are feeling better about yourself. Once you do, then you are on your way to recovery.\n\nLearn About Depression, tips and tricks , from our short daily flash briefings. \n\nThis tool does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
