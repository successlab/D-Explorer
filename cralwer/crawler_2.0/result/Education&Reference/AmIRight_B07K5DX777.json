Just when people start to think that Am I Right will always tell you that you are right, it will start telling everybody that they are wrong about everything! After a few minutes, the timer resets and you can ask a question again.\n\nNote that Am I Right doesn't look anything up, and it doesn't store your questions. It is a simple sleight-of-hand trick using timing. You need to make sure that you get the timing right, or the trick will not work.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
