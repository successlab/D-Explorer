Say \"Menu\" to return to the Scene List.\n\n[Changing the dialogue speed]\nSaying \"fast\", \"medium\" or \"slow\" will change the speed of the Japanese dialogue.\n\n[Dialogue Text]\nIf you use a Echo with screen screen, you can refer to the conversation text.\n* Due to the specifications of Alexa, the timing of the voice being spoken and the line being focused may occasionally be shifted. Please note.\n\n* \"Shadowing\" is a language learning method where you listen to a native audio recording, and then speak it aloud at the same time as the native speaker, but without reading the text.\n* \"Role-playing\" is an experiential learning method to enhance speaking performance by training in which participants role in a given scenario.\n* I would be grateful if you could let me know your impressions and opinions using this skill from the evaluation column of the Alexa application.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
