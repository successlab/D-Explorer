The high-pitched song is actually a mating call belted out by males. Each species has its own distinctive song that only attracts females of its own kind. Cicadas are the only insects capable of producing such a unique and loud sound. Depending on the species, a cicada might emerge as often as annually or as infrequently as every 17 years, but they expire approximately five to six weeks later.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
