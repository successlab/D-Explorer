This includes highlights of their lives, circumstances of their deaths, and beatification or canonization information. Just say, \"Alexa, tell me about another saint.\" You can also ask for references on each Saint to learn more about them, by saying, \"Alexa, tell me some references.\" Also, to learn about the process of becoming a Saint, you can ask, \"Alexa, how do you become a Saint?\" Saying, \"Alexa, help\" will tell you what you can do in the Skill, and \"Alexa, repeat\" will repeat what was spoken.\n\nCurrently, information about a little over 150 Saints is available. More Saints will be added over the next few months.\n\nThe source of this information is www.catholicsaints.info which was compiled over many years by Terry Jones. Terry had used a number of references for each Saint and some of those are listed in the Alexa App after each Saint\u2019s life is described. Some of those include: \n\nBook of Saints, by the Monks of Ramsgate\nCatholic Encyclopedia, by Michael Ott\nGolden Legend\nLives of the Saints, by Father Alban Butler\nNew Catholic Dictionary", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
