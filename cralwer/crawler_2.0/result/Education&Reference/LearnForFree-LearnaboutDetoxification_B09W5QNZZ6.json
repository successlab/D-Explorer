It enters from the foods we eat, the water we drink, and even from the air we breathe. And if it builds up in a massive number, toxins can harm us. Symptoms like wrinkles, bloating, loss of energy, and cellulite will soon appear.\n\nThe detox diet plan typically features two phases for the detoxification process to occur. The first phase is said to occur after the first three days of fasting. It is known by many detox experts as the monotrophic phase of the diet as the person involved in the plan only consume a single type of fruit with every meal. If you are preparing for your breakfast, for instance, you only need to choose a particular kind of fruit to consume and you are limited to only that. No more, no less.
