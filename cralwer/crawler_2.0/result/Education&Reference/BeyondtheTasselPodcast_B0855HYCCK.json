College isn\u2019t for everyone but, on average, about two out of every three kids choose to go to college. Our mission is to help kids make the most of that process, providing tools and insights to gain admission to the schools of their choice and to help parents with strategies to make college more affordable. Through this podcast, our local community engagement efforts, and our website, journey12.com, we hope to enhance the odds of young people finding a successful fit with their post-secondary transition process. Your kids are just as smart and hardworking as kids anywhere, and on our podcast, we strive to level the playing field for your students as they ramp up for their chosen post-secondary intentions, including military, the trades, family business, college, and the world of work. Episodes drop every week. Subscribe to always have access to the latest insights.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
