But arthritis, contrary to what some may believe, is not just one disease. It is, in fact, comprised of more than a hundred different rheumatic diseases and conditions that mainly affect the joints (hence, its name) although some specific types target the tissues which surround the joint as well as other connective tissue. What is arthritis and what specific type it is can be determined by the pattern, severity, and location of symptoms. As typical in most rheumatic conditions, the patient often suffers from pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. In addition, these symptoms can develop all of a sudden or go through a gradual progression. In some cases, the disease may even affect the immune system and various internal organs of the body.
