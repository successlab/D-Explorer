Nonetheless, these same people do not know how to go about the vacuuming process. The vacuuming process does not have to be done on a daily basis but, whenever you do it, you should get the best out of it by doing it the right way. Preparation Before you even start to vacuum, prepare your carpet for the process. The preparation stage involves removing all toys, clothes and other loose items from the surface of the carpet. Ensure you remove any and all items that can result in damage to your vacuum. These items include wires that might be carelessly discarded on the carpet. You can even use a broom to sweep the carpet and the baseboards, to remove the dirt in hard to reach areas. The sweeping process also helps in removing dangerous substances that are likely to reduce the efficiency of the vacuum. Check the Vacuum After preparing your carpet, ensure that the vacuum is in the right working condition. Replace the airbags and empty the canister to ensure that the unit has the potential for maximum suction performance. Adjust the height of your vacuum to suit the requirement of your carpet. The high adjustment is for thick carpets and the low one for medium pile carpets. During Vacuuming Start the vacuuming process. Ensure that you start from the farthest corner in your houses and work backward. If your home has many levels, start with the highest level and work downwards, in this way you will use less energy and also increases the suction performance of the unit. The suction power of your unit comes from pulling the unit backward rather than pushing it forward. Additional Tips Vacuuming should be done strategically. Avoid going through the process fast. Instead, use many short strokes in different directions to increase efficiency, as well as prevent wearing out the carpet. Vacuuming in different directions helps in preventing the formation of track marks, which are marks in worn out parts caused by vacuuming in the same direction over a long period. To avoid destroying your carpet, ensure to push the vacuum in different directions. Ensure you move your furniture so that your vacuum can access all areas. You should also get as close to the doors as possible and also get as close to the wall as far as possible. Any region that will not be thoroughly vacuumed may be a source of stress later. So, ensure that you do the chore right instead of wasting a lot of time and having to redo it again later.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
