Quiz:\nIn starting a quiz, you can choose how many questions to be asked. You are then asked either for the chemical structure of a specific ion name or for the name of a specific chemical structure. Each round, the item and property is randomized, allowing for the best study experience possible. If you get one wrong, you can try again. When you end the quiz, it will tell you your score!\n\n2. Chemical Structures:\nAsk what the chemical structure is for an ion, and it will tell you!\n\n3. Ion Names:\nAsk what the name of a chemical structure is, and it will tell you!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
