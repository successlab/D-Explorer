It began on April 12, 1861 with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Though there were many important battles over the course of the Civil War, Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg is generally considered the point which decisively turned the war in their favor. The most famous Confederate general of the war is Robert E. Lee. He won numerous battles against far superior Union armies including the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Chancellorsville. The most renowned Union general is Ulysses S. Grant, who led the Union Army of Tennessee to several famous victories including the critical Siege of Vicksburg. The last important battle of the American Civil War was the Battle of Appomattox Court House which resulted in Robert E. Lee surrendering to Ulysses S. Grant. It was followed by a series of surrenders by Confederate generals leading to the end of the war. Here are the 10 most important battles of the American Civil War.\n\n At any point, you can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit the skill.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
