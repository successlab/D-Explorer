If you want to buy that car a house or just simply get approved for a credit card without the butterflies in your stomach because you know you have damaged or bruised credit. Dont worry anymore, there is a way out. You dont have to have bad credit at all. Infact, the FCRA(Fair Credit Reporting Act) law states that if a credit bureau can not prove an account on your credit report belongs to you. It must be removed. 79% of all credit reports have errors on them and all you have to do is pull your reports, find the errors and dispute them using certified mail and then send letters to all three credit bureaus disputing the accounts and wait the 30 days they have to respond to your dispute. Do not send them a bunch of disputes thinking they will remove everything from your report. They will not. It must be a legitimate claim like the statute of limitations has run out in your state. Its the wrong name maybe a parent you were named after and they somehow mix up the information. Places where you never lived, jobs you never had, inquiries from companies you never heard of or approved to run your credit. Remember they have to prove its your debt, not the other way around. If they cant, seeya bad debt and hello new credit score. If the bureaus are not able to provide you with proof that a debt on your credit report belongs to you, they have to remove the debt from your credit report by law thereby raising your credit score. All you have to do now is add the proper primary tradelines that are within your budget to have and authorized user accounts to move even faster. This can all be done for you if you hire a professional. Or you can take the time and do it for yourself for free. A professional will cost you anywhere between $59 and $99 a month. Any more than that and you are getting ripped off. Make sure the credit consultant lets you know the pros and cons of credit repair and do not let them tell you they can get you a certain score in a certain amount of time because for one its illegal and two its a lie. Learn your rights and let the law fix your credit the right way over time. Keep in mind you must be patient. It took years to get your credit in the condition it is in. But should take less than a year to get it where it needs to be.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
