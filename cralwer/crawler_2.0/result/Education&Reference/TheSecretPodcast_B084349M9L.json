He spent a year or so traveling around the country, burying small ceramic boxes two feet underground. He wrote a few poems, and had a friend of his paint some images. The goal was to get the reader to match a poem with a verse, produce a treasure map of sorts, then go dig up the treasures. He thought it would be easy. 40 years later we are finding out he was wrong. So far three treasures have been found. One in Chicago, one in Cleveland, and one in Boston\u2026 so at least we know they are real. That\u2019s about all we know for sure. This project started with Byron recruiting a bunch of his friends. Sean and Ted to write some descriptions of strange creatures that Byron\u2019s friend JoEllen sculpted out of clay and cloth, which were photographed by his childhood friend Ben. Then Byron\u2019s friends John Palencar, John Pierard, and Overton Loyd made a bunch of images with the sole purpose of confusing us. The project was created by a community of friends, and it is my opinion that a community of friends is the only way to solve it. The goal of this podcast is to combine ALL the available information on The Secret, in an open and transparent medium, so that the community as a whole, may be able to solve the remaining nine. Good luck everyone. Party on.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
