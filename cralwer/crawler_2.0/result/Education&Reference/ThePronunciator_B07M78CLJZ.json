Previously, the skill used to clear the word immediately after each pronunciation.\n* You can now clear the word you've been building at anytime by saying: \"restart\"\n* Although we still encourage that you spell each letter out one at a time, we recognize that sometimes you may not have the time to do that. Thus, we've added a method for you to get a \"speed pronunciation\". Just say the word \"say\" followed by all of the letters!\n\nJust spell the word out and let Alexa tell you how it's pronounced! Simple as that!\n\nWorks for words and non-words alike. If it isn't a word, Alexa will do its best to pronounce it. The skill works as follows:\n\n* When prompted, speak each letter slowly to maximize the chances of Alexa understanding the letter.\n\n* Wait for Alexa to repeat the letter before proceeding. There is a small chance Alexa might misunderstand.\n\nAnother reason for not having the user spell out all of the letters at once is to respect the 8 second timeout that Alexa has on responses. If the word is too long, or if the letters are spoken too slowly, there is a very good chance that that timeout will occur. By speaking one letter at a time, we hope to reduce such a likelihood.\n\n* When you are finished, just say, \"done\"\n\nIf you are in a rush and don't have the time to have Alexa recognize each letter that you say, you can get the skill to do a \"speed pronunciation\". Just say the word \"say\" followed by all of the letters. Do keep in mind though that there is a higher chance that Alexa will misunderstand some of the letters that you say.\n\nHere are some other useful commands:\n\n* restart - Tell Alexa to clear all of the letters and start once more with an empty word.\n* done - Tell Alexa to pronounce the word using the current letters spoken.\n* undo - Tell Alexa to undo the last letter spoken. This is in case Alexa misunderstood the letter.\n\nIf you enjoyed this skill and want to check out some of my other skills, feel free to checkout my website here:\n\nhttps://alexa-skill-dev.gitlab.io/alexaWebsite/", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
