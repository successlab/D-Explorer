Ballroom dance is not just the Waltz. Ballroom dance can be elegant and sophisticated (like the Waltz) but it can also be hot, sultry and sexy (like the Tango or Paso Doble), or a good bit of lively fun (like the Fox Trot Jive or Quick Step). \n\nWebster defines ballroom dancing as simply \"Any of various, usually social dances in which couples perform set moves\". The word \"ball\", when referring to a social gathering as opposed to a child's toy, comes from the Latin \"ballare\" meaning to dance. This is the base for ballroom (a room for dancing), ballet (a dance), and ballerina (a dancer). \n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries ballroom dancing was very popular among the upper classes of England. It didn't really catch on with the working class until the late 19th and early 20th century. In the early 1920's competitive ballroom dancing was gaining popularity so the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (formerly known as The Imperial Society of Dance Teachers) formed a Ballroom Branch whose function was to standardize the ballroom dances. \n\nLearn About Ballroom Dancing, from our short daily flash briefings. \n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
