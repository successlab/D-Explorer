There are three levels in the game Easy, Medium, and Hard, \u2018easy\u2019 level being the first and simplest while \u2018hard\u2019 being the highest and the toughest. Not only does the game test a player\u2019s ability to identify parts of speech. It also provides a demonstration on identifying parts of speech at the start of each level for beginners to get the drift. Thus making the skill easy and accessible to any user with the least possible knowledge of the concept. \nOnce you\u2019ve enabled the voice app, just say Alexa, open Parts of Speech, and use the following commands:\n\nTo pick a game level:\nJust say \u201cEasy\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d, or \u201cHard\u201d. \n\nTo understand the rules of the game, say \u201chelp\u201d.\n\nTo pass over a question, say \u201cskip\u201d.\n\nTo listen to the question again, say \u201crepeat\u201d. \n\nTo switch to another game level, say \u201cchange level\u201d.\n\nTo erase your progress and start fresh, say \u201creset the game\u201d.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
