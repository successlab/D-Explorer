You can choose to practice per set of intervals or have me randomly picked them up.\n\nThere are two modes, basic and expert. Basic mode focuses on a set of intervals and both notes and interval naming guides are said. You will only need to state the quality of the interval (augmented, major, minor, perfect). Expert mode doesn't provide any guide and picks intervals at random. You need to respond with the full interval name \"major third\".\nSpecific interval sets can be selected by saying their name \"thirds\", \"fourths\" and so on.\nInterval guides and note guides can be shut by saying \"No interval guide\" or \"no notes guides\" (\"interval guide\" and \"say notes\" will bring them back).\nInterval direction can be changed by saying \"Descending\" or \"Ascending\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
