Listen to this interactive story about a big cat you name, who drags a pursuer for miles, letting him survive the encounter, to tell people a story of respecting the privacy and lives of wildlife. Maybe you need to rethink your role in evolution, and realize that wildlife are sentient beings too , with emotion. Maybe they deserve to be left alone, in the woods, where they live, and not stalked and pursued in a 'game'?\n At any point, you can say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit the skill. \nThis skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
