The International Space Station completes multiple orbits around Earth every day, and now you can track the space lab as it passes overhead. \n\nWe can also get it from Alexa by triggering or saying that open \"iss tracker\" and it will give the location by using coordinates of latitude and longitude here iss represent to the international space station.\n\nThe ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research, with power, data, cooling, and crew available to support experiments. Small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments, especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space, but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers. And by using this skill we can get the current/present location of the international space station.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
