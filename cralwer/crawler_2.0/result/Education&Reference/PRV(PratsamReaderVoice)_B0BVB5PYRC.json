(Pratsam Reader Voice) is a voice assistant service enabling organizations such as libraries to provide end-users with audiobook content. The service enables the visually impaired and other print-disabled to play and navigate accessible audiobook formats such as DAISY by using voice commands.\n\nTo get started, select the 'Enable Skill' button in the Alexa App to create an account with a demo -service that has a selection of DAISY book samples instantly available for you. When opening the skill, a bookshelf will be available where you can choose a demo book to play. Pause playback to access more functionality, such as:\n\n- Add bookmarks to books for later access: say \"Alexa, pause\" and when paused, say \"Add bookmark\".\n\n- Navigate in the book by pages and heading: say \"Alexa, pause\" and when paused, say \"Skip 3 headings forward\".\n\n- Open the bookshelf to select another book: say \"Alexa, pause\" and when paused, say \"Open the bookshelf\".\n\n- Get information about the reading position: say \"Alexa, pause\" and when paused, say \"Where am I\".\n\n- Access a help section with a detailed description of how to use the skill: say \"Alexa, pause\" and when paused, say \"Help me\".\n\nThe service connects to a library demo service, enabled by the DAISY Online Delivery Protocol and provided by Pratsam Server.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
