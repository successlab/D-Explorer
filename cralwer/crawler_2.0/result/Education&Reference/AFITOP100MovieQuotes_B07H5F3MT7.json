Every quote is spoken by Alexa, or makes use of her built-in functionality. You won't find any movie audio clips here! Obviously, results vary from quote to quote; some are amazingly accurate and will sync perfectly with the actual quote, while others are humorously bad. Definitely not the most ground-breaking skill available on Alexa enabled devices, but it is a fun example of what can be done with her speech using various Amazon services.\n\nHOW TO USE: \nSimply just say, \"Alexa, open Top Movie Quotes\", after the short introduction just ask Alexa to \"get a quote\". At anytime you can ask for help by saying, \"help\" or have Alexa repeat the last quote by saying, \"repeat\" or \"say again\".", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
