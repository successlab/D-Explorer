You then give your answers by saying the name of the element, in this case \"Helium\".\n\nThe Periodic Table Quiz is aimed at students that need to practice the the periodic table. The quiz has been programmed from scratch by Software Engineer Geoff Hayward https://www.geoffhayward.eu with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience. The quiz has been well tested in order to maximise your enjoyment and learning. \n\nOnce you enabled The Periodic Table Quiz on your Alexa device, say \"Alexa, start The Periodic Table Quiz\". Answer each question out loud, just saying what you think the answer is. If you need to hear the question again, you can ask the quiz to \"repeat the question\". If you have no idea what the answer is, just say \"pass\", \"skip\" or \"sausages\".\n\nThe Periodic Table Quiz does not collect personal details.
