There are doubts amongst students and parents on whether they should do the studies as per the NCERT books or as per other books available in the market. This article will address these questions and help the students and parents to clear their concerns.\n\n National Council of Educational Research and Training is an independent organization of the Government of India set up in India with the sole objective to design and implement a common education system in the entire country.\n\nCurrently, the role of NCERT is to develop study material for students from class 1 to class 12 which includes the development of NCERT Textbooks, learning material for students, teaching material and reference material for teachers, audio and visual education content, organize various national level examinations and much other useful education material for school level students.\n\nNCERT books have been designed in an easy to read and understand format. The teachers in the schools should make the students read and understand the chapters in the schools class room itself. The teachers should make the students understand all the concepts which are given in each chapter. The concentration should be more on making the students understand the topics and concepts more rather than solving the questions which are given at the end of each chapter. The whole purpose of teaching should be to make the student understand the concept and the preparation of the student should be such that if any question comes in the exams from part of the chapter, the student should be able to answer the question from his understanding and not from what he has mugged up. The students should start from plain reading of the chapters followed by a discussion on the topics with the teacher and other students and making sure their understanding is correct followed by solving the questions which are given at the end of the NCERT chapters.\n\nThe skill presents audio in the Hindi and English Languages.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
