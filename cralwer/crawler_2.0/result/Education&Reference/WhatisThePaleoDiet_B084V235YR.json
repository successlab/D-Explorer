This is often referred to as the \u2018cavemen\u2019 diet because it is how our early ancestors ate and lived. Several questions will come to people\u2019s minds when they first hear of the paleo diet. Is it healthy? Is it expensive? Why do I have to sacrifice my favorite foods? Is it uncivilized? All these questions are often based on misconceptions and false notions. The paleo diet though slightly restrictive is perfectly healthy and sustainable. As with anything that needs to become a habit, it will take some time to adapt to the paleo diet and make it a way of life. Most diets are not sustainable in the long run.
