You can ask questions to learn about a gene's expression in the body, convert entrez gene IDs to gene symbols, learn about gene localization, and catch up on the latest information from Gene RIFs. It supports human, mouse, and rat genes.\n\nThe skill itself is designed in such a way as to be open source and extensible. The source code for lambda functions and utterances are freely available at Github: https://github.com/solinvicta/geneTeller .
