There are many methods and approaches, some involving letting children \"cry it out\" and others advocating more flexible collaborations with the child to minimize stress.\n\nRegardless of which method works best with your child, a consistent routine is critical to success.\n\nNap Scape from Brainsprays allows parents simply say \"start nap\" to begin a morning and an afternoon nap routine is created. Most families see an improvement within a couple of weeks and eventually establish a nap routine.\n\nWith more sleep comes more opportunities for everyone in the household to be their best everyday.\n\nJust say \"Alexa, start Nap Scape\" to get started.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
