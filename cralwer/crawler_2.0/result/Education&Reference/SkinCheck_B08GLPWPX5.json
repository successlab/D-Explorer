But it can usually be treated successfully if caught early, so doctors recommend conducting a monthly skin self-examination to look for suspicious moles.\n\nAlexa can now help you to do this. Simply say \"Alexa, open Skin Check\" and you'll be guided through the 'ABCDE' signs of melanoma skin cancer, and a 7-step process for checking your body.\n\nTo perform your skin check, you\u2019ll need to be in front of a large mirror and have a hand-held mirror so you can see hard-to-reach places. You will also need a comb.\n \nIf you do find anything that concerns you, please have it checked by a dermatologist or doctor, and remember that skin cancer is often treatable when detected early.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nSkin Check has been developed by The Global Melanoma Coalition as part of a global programme to build public awareness of melanoma skin cancer and the need for its early detection and treatment.\n\nThe Global Melanoma Coalition (formerly the Global Coalition for Melanoma Patient Advocacy) was formed in 2014 by the Melanoma Research Foundation in response to the global need to bring the patient voice to the melanoma space. The group has grown to include organisations from 27 different countries and is enthusiastically supported by its partners around the world, as well as the global patient, healthcare and pharmaceutical communities. The Global Melanoma Coalition meets the vital needs of the worldwide melanoma community through three working groups, which each specialise in a unique area that addresses globally relevant issues for melanoma patients, encompassing melanoma awareness, access to treatment, and clinical trial design and access.
