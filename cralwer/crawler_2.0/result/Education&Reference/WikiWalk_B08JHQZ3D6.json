Though Alexa Entities was my original candidate, it is currently not compatible with Alexa Conversations, so I chose the WikiData knowledge base and its API.\n\nFor this demonstration skill, the entire conversation is managed by the Alexa Conversations model, using two dialog models.\n\nThe skill scenario is: \na user asks about a subject. Wiki Walk queries WikiData about the subject, returns a description and asks the user if this is what was expected. If the answer is \u201cNo\u201d, Wiki Walk asks what was expected. Based on that answer, Wiki Walk looks at other candidate descriptions for entities to find a best next suggestion.\n\nIf the answer to is this what was expected is \u201cYes\u201d, WikiWalk will start with the subject, and walk back up to six levels in a hierarchy of inclusion, describing the subject\u2019s path through the hierarchy (up to ten levels).\n\n(WikiData includes multiple properties for a given entity, and includes several properties that indicate a hierarchy: \u201cX is a part of Y\u201d, \u201cX is a subset of Y\u201d, etc. Wiki Walk chains them together for you.)\n\nTry: \"What is Washington?\"\n\nSee: https://www.wikidata.org/ for more information about WikiData.\nIcon by Gan Khoon Lay : Creative Commons CCBY", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
