This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: hyper sensitivity", "reviewnum": " 1", "des": "While a typical individual is able to \"tune out\" sounds that aren't important to them, for individuals with hypersensitivity to audio, which is common in disorders such as autism, Fragile X syndrome, and Williams syndrome, they hear all of the sounds around them at the same volume and intensity. This simulation seeks to help you understand and sympathize with others. Listen, learn, and understand.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
