You can start by watching videos about implementing Alexa skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa Presentation Language. Moreover, the skill also provides the ability to ask questions about topics you want to learn and find relevant answers about the content presented in the video series 'Zero to Hero: A comprehensive course to building an Alexa Skill'. You can find the video series on YouTube, and they are used here with permission from their authors, for illustration and education purposes only. No affiliation or partnership with Amazon derives from using the video files.\n\nThe advantage of exploring the video series inside this skill is that you can have a conversation about their content and reference any topic inside them by asking Alexa to search for it. Alexa will then find the most relevant passage for your question and will start playing the video from that timestamp. You can also control the player using your voice and play the videos from the list by title or by number. This can be a huge time saver if you want to keep this knowledge at your fingertips while you learn to implement a skill and reference it at short notice. \n\nThe skill's main feature is to provide convenience during your journey of learning by providing a mechanism to obtain insight into the content of instructional videos by simply asking your questions in a conversation. The implementation uses several Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning services in order to allow you to search inside the content of multimedia files and find the most relevant answers in an intuitive and efficient way. This can help you in the journey of learning about how Alexa skills are implemented by asking Alexa questions about the content of the instructional videos in the 'Zero to Hero' series. \n\nMore generally, the skill illustrates how a multi-modal skill can help the user in the quest of exploring information in multimedia files. Whether the knowledge you are looking for is inside an instructional video or an audio format, or typing and reading is not accessible, this project provides a solution for finding it in a conversationally intuitive and efficient way.\n\nThe skill will provide the best experience on devices that support visuals and touch. Because the main feature is to search inside the video files on audio-only devices the interaction is minimal.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
