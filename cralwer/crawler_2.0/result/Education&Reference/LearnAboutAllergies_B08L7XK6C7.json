Why do some people have them while others don\u2019t? And why are people with one allergy more inclined to have many?\n\nThe immune system is set up to protect our bodies from harmful, foreign substances. \n\nLike viruses and bacteria (dirt and germs). Sometimes the immune system doesn\u2019t develop properly or is just oversensitive and doesn\u2019t react right.\n\nIn these cases, it reacts to things that aren\u2019t harmful and don\u2019t usually cause people any problems.\nThese things are called allergens. The term allergens is just an easier way to say \"things that cause allergies\".\n\nWhen the oversensitive or improperly developed immune system sees these allergens, it sends out chemicals like histamine. It\u2019s the histamines that cause the symptoms that are common with allergies.\n\nSymptoms like itching, watery eyes, runny nose, swelling, hives or rashes. Different people have different symptoms, but the causes are the same.\n \nThe symptoms that are displayed depend on the part of the body the allergen comes in contact with. Allergens that are breathed in, like pollen or dust cause coughing or wheezing, stuffy or runny noses and an itchy nose and throat.\n\nPlant allergies usually come in contact with the skin, so they cause rashes.\n \nFood allergies usually result in nausea, vomiting, stomach pains or in severe cases, life threatening reactions. Drug allergies tend to involve the entire body, so they have a variety of symptoms.\n\n\nLearn About Allergies from our short daily flash briefings. \n\nThis tool does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
