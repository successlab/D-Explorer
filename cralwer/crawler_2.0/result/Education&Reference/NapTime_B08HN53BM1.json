There are many methods and approaches, some involving letting children \"cry it out\" and others advocating more flexible collaborations with the child to minimize stress.\n\nRegardless of which method works best with your child, a consistent routine is critical to success.\n\nNap Time from Brainsprays allows parents to answer a few questions about their child and their nap goals. Based on your responses a morning and an afternoon nap routine is created. Most families see an improvement within a couple of weeks and eventually a routine is established.\n\nWith more sleep comes more opportunities for everyone in the household to be their best everyday.\n\nJust say \"Alexa, start Nap Time\" to get started.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
