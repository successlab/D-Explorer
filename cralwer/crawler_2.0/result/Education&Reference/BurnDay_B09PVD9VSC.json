If you are aware of local burning restrictions not present in this skill, please provide us feedback by leaving this skill a review.\n\nHow is the fuel burning status calculated?\nWe take the air quality index for a given zip code to calculate the fine and coarse particulate matter for the provided zip code. The burn status is then calculated based on local ordinances/regulations.\n\nWhy did the zip code I provide result in an air quality status being returned?\nBurning restriction thresholds differ across local municipalities, at this time we do not have specific burning regulations for that zip code. Please check back in the future as we are adding new zip codes with each feature release.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
