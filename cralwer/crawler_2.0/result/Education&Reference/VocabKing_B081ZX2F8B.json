It doesn't matter whether you're studying for school or studying abroad. \nThe specific vocabulary allows you to concentrate fully on your field of study and you don't have to acquire a vocabulary that you don't need anyway. \nThereby the vocab king tells you the German terms for which you have to provide the English translation in a continuous loop. This direction is necessary for Alexa to understand you properly. \nIf you prefer to learn the other way around, you must set your Alexa to German. \n\nThe following learning categories are currently available: \n-vacation \n-economy \n-computer science \n\nIn order for you to learn as efficiently as possible, we have integrated the Spaced Repetition System (SRS).\nThis is a scientifically proven system that remembers which vocabulary you already know and which you do not.\nThus only those vocabulary are queried which you either don't know yet or haven't answered for a long time.\nIf you have an Echo Show, you will be visually supported to achieve even better learning results on top. \nSo, let's go, show the world what you're made of and become the vocabulary king! \nJust like you, we want to constantly improve ourselves. For this we depend on your feedback and would be pleased about constructive criticism and improvement suggestions :-).", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
