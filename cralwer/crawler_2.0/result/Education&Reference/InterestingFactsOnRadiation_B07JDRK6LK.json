However, there is and has been a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding its effects. A lot of it stems from radiation\u2019s link to nuclear weapons. In fact, even the US government has made some very misleading statements about radiation in the past. For example, after dropping the nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, the US claimed that there wouldn\u2019t be any fallout radiation or that it wouldn\u2019t have any negative effects. Unfortunately, it did. Since then we have learned a lot about radiation and its effects on the human body as you will soon see with these intense facts about radiation.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
