All are run by students, and they create more than a thousand leadership opportunities.\n\nAll clubs and organizations at the College exist because a student or a group of students wanted them to exist; so if you have an interest and there\u2019s no club to match it, go ahead and start a new one. We'll help you through the process. The college takes seriously the standard of care that is needed for selected club sports programs and at times does limit opportunities in this area.\n\nThis skill helps you to learn more about Gettysburg College's various clubs and organizations.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
