Just say \"Alexa, what's my flash briefing\" \u2014 and you're ready to take it to the streets and fight to write! (Say \"Alexa, stop\" to exit anytime.)\n\nStreet Writers is a once-a-week 10-minute, two-fisted take on getting you writing\u2014 powerfully, productively and with plenty of punch. Writing as a craft calls for tenacity, consistency and the courage to face an empty page. Mark Bellusci and Dan Chichester are pros at bare-knuckle writing for stage, film, editorial, marketing and comics. This Flash Briefing is a 1 minute edit drawn from the podcast's popular \"Take A Swing At This\" segment, which leads off every episode with a hard-earned technique to help you roll up your sleeves, beat down the demons, and move that project forward \u2014 be it a novel, ad, play, press release, game, screenplay or shopping list. \n\nFind full episodes of Street Writers everywhere podcasts are served up \u2014 or go directly to anchor.fm/streetwriters to browse episodes filled with writing inspiration, motivation and activation.\n\n(This skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
