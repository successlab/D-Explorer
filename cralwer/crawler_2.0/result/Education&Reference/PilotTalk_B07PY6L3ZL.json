The virtual instructor will let you know what to say and then ask for follow up items if you missed anything. You can ask for an example at any time. As we add more and more scenarios, you will be able to navigate yourself through the busy skies just like a professional pilot on the radios. Be sure to say your commands fast because Alexa stops listening after eight seconds.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
