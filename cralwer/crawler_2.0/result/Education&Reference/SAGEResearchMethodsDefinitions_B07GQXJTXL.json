Use this skill to quickly learn more about research methods, to decompose methods or to find related terms. This skill is based on the SAGE Research Methods ontology, a specially curated collection of methods terms, definitions, and relationships. \n\nExample methods can be high level terms such as 'Statistics' or 'Hypothesis', or lower level terms such as 'Confidence Intervals' or 'Standard Error'.\n\nThere are three commands you can issue to the skill, as follows:\n\n(1) Get a research method definition:\n\"ask Sage to define ....\"\n\"ask Sage what ... means?\"\n\n(2) Decompose a research method into lower-level terms:\n\"ask Sage to decompose ... \"\n\n(3) Get a list of related methods:\n\"ask Sage what ... is related to\"\n\"ask Sage to get relationships for ...\"\n\nYou could, for example, use this skill to:\n- find the definition of the research method \"Multivariate models\"\n- get a list of lower level terms for the same\n- based on the returned list, query methods that are related to \"Econometrics\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
