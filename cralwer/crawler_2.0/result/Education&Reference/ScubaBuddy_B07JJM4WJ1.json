It can calculate the Maximum Operating Depth (MOD), Best Blend, Equivalent Air Depth (EAD), Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PPO2), Actual Gas Supply, Back Gas Turn Pressure, and Gas Requirement Estimate. \n\nScuba Buddy uses your device's settings to determine if the calculations will be calculated using metric or US/Imperial.\n\nThe easiest way to get the value you need is to ask Scuba Buddy to calculate it for you, Scuba Buddy will ask you for each of the required parameters for the calculations, for example:\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate the maximum operating depth.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate the best blend.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate the Equivalent air depth.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my actual gas supply.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my back gas turn pressure.\"\n\"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my gas requirement estimate.\"\n\nIf you know what values are required, you can use them when you ask for the calculations, for example:\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy what is the M O D for thirty six percent nitrox?\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy what is the maximum operating depth for thirty six percent nitrox?\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to tell me the M O D for E A N X thirty two.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to tell me the equivalent air depth for fifty percentage nitrox at seventy feet.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to tell me the equivalent air depth for E A N X thirty two at seventy feet.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy what is the best blend for one hundred thirty feet?\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy what is the best nitrox mix for one hundred thirty feet?\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to tell me the partial pressure of oxygen for fifty percentage nitrox at seventy feet.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy what is the partial pressure of oxygen for E A N X thirty two at seventy feet?\"\n\nTechnical calculations can only be accessed using the samples below, due to the number of parameters required for each calculation.\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my actual gas supply.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my back gas turn pressure.\"\n\n- \"Alexa ask Scuba Buddy to calculate my gas requirement estimate.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
