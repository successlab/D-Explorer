It is the third most common physical ailment behind heart decease and arthritis. Several studies over the last few years show a link between hearing loss and dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nUntreated hearing loss can be linked to several other serious illnesses.\n\nHearing loss acquired in adult life can have serious and far-reaching consequences for the individual concerned. Traditionally, hearing loss has been viewed as a quality of life issue, not as a high-risk condition. Medical research, however, directly links hearing loss and auditory deprivation to more serious social and medical conditions that far outweigh the inability to hear well. 9 out of 10 people indicate that their quality of life has improved with hearing aids. Extensive research over the last 30 years indicates that treatment with hearing aids results in improved social, emotional, psychological and physical well-being for patients and their families.\n\nMany patients experience stress, social withdrawal or emotional difficulty as a result of their hearing loss. Our adjustment counseling enables the patient to move toward positive action. All practitioners encourage and support change in patients through a positive process. We encourage patients to think beyond hearing instruments as a solution for their communication deficits.\n\nIt may take patient weeks or even longer become fully adjusted to their new hearing instruments. The ultimate goal for adult aural rehabilitation is to reduce hearing-loss-induced deficits inactivity, participation and quality of life.\n\nAuditory deprivation is the term used for a decrease in speech and sound understanding due to a hearing loss. Hearing loss deprives the auditory centers in the brain of normal activity causing the deterioration of brain function. Hearing aids and Hearing Trainer will help keep the auditory centers of your brain active.\n\nWe want to bring all this to you!
