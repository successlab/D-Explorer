This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: civics test", "reviewnum": " 14", "des": "This skill will help you prepare for the United States naturalization test. The skill mimics the real USCIS exam by randomly asking 10 questions out of the 100 possible questions. Answers are not presented as multiple choice questions; rather you are supposed to say out the answer yourself. This is exactly how you would be tested during your naturalization interview.\n\nThe skill has a quiz mode and a training mode. In Quiz mode you are asked 10 random questions and at the end you are presented your score. \n\nIn training mode, the 100 questions are divided into 5 sets of 20 questions each (we call them question sets). This allows you to focus on 20 questions at a time. Questions from a question set are asked sequentially and if your answer is incorrect, the skill tells you the correct answer; so that you can learn and remember.\n\nTo make learning easy, we have worked with an experienced academician to come up with the preparation format.\n\nPREMIUM CONTENT\nIn training mode questions from 21 - 100 i.e question sets 2, 3, 4 and 5 are available as part of one time in-skill purchase. Questions 1 - 20 are available for free\n\nAbout 12 Tech: We are a tech consulting company and specialize in voice apps for Alexa.
