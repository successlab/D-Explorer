Expert consensus and evidence based guidelines are available to help guide follow-up and to aid in lesion characterization. \n\nThis skill allows a user to ask \"RAD Assistant\" for 2017 Fleischner Society pulmonary nodule follow-up recommendations, 2015 SRU ovarian cyst follow-up guidelines and to perform adrenal nodule washout calculations. Users also have an option to further characterize the risk of malignancy of a pulmonary nodule by the Brock (Pan-Can) equation. \n\nThe skill is designed for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for clinical judgement by a licensed physician. In other words, \"RAD Assistant\" should not be relied upon for patient care. The authors make no claim of accuracy and confirmation of all calculations and recommendations is advised.\n\nFurther reading: \n1. MacMahon, et. al.
