It will search local listings, give you a short summary of prices, and send details to your Alexa app so you can follow up later.\n\nSearch nearby:\n\nIf your device supports location services, such as a mobile phone or in-car Alexa-enabled device, this skill can search around your current location. To enable this feature you will have to grant permission to access your location in the skill settings in your Alexa app. You may also need to enable location services and have the Alexa app open.\n\nFind homes by location:\n\nIf location services are not available or you haven't granted permission, you can check home prices just by providing a zip code for the skill to search.
