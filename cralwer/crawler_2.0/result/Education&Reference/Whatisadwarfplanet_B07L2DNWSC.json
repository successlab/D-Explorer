By definition a dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydro-statically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit.\n\n\nThis skill was built with love by VoiceApps.com.
