As your unlucky twin stays on earth, you travel to and from a celestial object that is some distance in light years away at a certain fraction of the speed of light. The change of velocity is assumed to be instantaneous. The user inputs:\n1. One way distance to object, in Light years\n2. Speed, as a fraction of the speed of light i.e. \"Zero point Five\"\n\nAccording to the laws of relativity, the twin that is in the space ship will be younger depending on how long their journey is and how fast they are going. When given the two inputs stated above, the skill will tell you how much each twin as aged when the twin on the spaceship has come back to earth. The skill also displays how much younger the twin who was in the spaceship is than the twin who is on earth.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
