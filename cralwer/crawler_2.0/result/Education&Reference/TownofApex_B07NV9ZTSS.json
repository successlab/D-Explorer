It is 19 square miles of land bordering Cary and is 11 miles south of Research Triangle Park. Eight miles to the west is Jordan Lake. Apex encompasses the community of Friendship at its southern border. In 1994, the downtown area was designated a Historic District. Several buildings date to the late 1800s. It is an example of an intact turn-of-the-century railroad town. The Apex train depot, built in 1867, is designated a Wake County landmark. The depot location marks the highest point on the old Chatham Railroad, hence the town's name. The town motto is -The Peak of Good Living.
