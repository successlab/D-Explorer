However the truth is that a large number of adults do suffer from it. This leads to physical, psychological and social effects on persons suffering from acne.\n\nThis effects can be long-lasting and cause problems. With adults, acne leaves behind permanent and ugly scars since as the skin ages and loses collagen, it takes longer for the scars to heal.\n\nIt may be hard to diagnose psychological effects due to common misconceptions that accompany them. For instance it would be logical to say that the psychological effects of adult acne is easier to deal with since the person has matured and is not prone to teenage tantrums. However in actual reality the psychological effect in adults may be even worse, since this is a condition perceived to be specific to teens.\n\n\nLearn About Acne from our short daily flash briefings. \n\nThis tool does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
