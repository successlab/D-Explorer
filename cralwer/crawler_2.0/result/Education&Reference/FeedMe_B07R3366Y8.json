This topic is intended to be some broad science such as chemistry so that the user's specific interest in this field can later be pinpointed.\n\nEach following day, a user can prompt our skill by calling \u201cFeed Me\u201d to their Alexa. Alexa will respond by reading a short summarized version of an article based off of this initial interest. The user is then prompted at the end of the article to respond with what they liked most about the article. \nFeed me uses this response to find a new article for the following day that is more suited to their interest but still in their original topic. This whole process takes about 2 minutes on average and is meant to take as little time as possible. \n\nFeed Me has the potential to revolutionize how students pick up on their interests, helping students discover topics they never thought they were interested in. Feed Me can help us pick up on interests that we might just not have the time to do traditionally. But by just taking a couple of minutes out of our day, for a couple of weeks, we can find those interests we never knew we had and learn about these interests each day from Alexa. We can feed our curiosity.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
