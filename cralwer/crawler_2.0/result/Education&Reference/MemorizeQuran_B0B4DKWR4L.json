It uses Minshawi Moalem, which is a scholar reading the verse of the Quran, then students repeating after him.\n\nThere are four ways to use this skill, levels and chapters:\n---------------------------------------------\nLEVELS:\n---------------------------------------------\nThere are four levels in the skill.\n1. Level 1: Surah Fatiha + Surrah 144 to Surah 99\n2. Level 2: Juz 30 + Surah Fatiha\n3. Level 3: First 10 Ayahs (verses) of Surah Kahf\n4. Level 4: Last 10 Ayahs (verses) of Surah Kahf\n\n* How can I use the levels?\n1. Play level one every day for 1-2 months\n2. You will notice after sometime the two month mark that you are completing the Surahs with the reciter.\n3. After you feel you have a good grasp of the Surahs, start level 2.\n4. Play level 2 for a month or two and repeat the step number 2 with the new Surahs.\n5. After you feel you memorized Juz 30, now it is time to go to a teacher to formally start learning.\n\n* How to play the levels:\n1. To start say: \"Alexa, start memorize quran\"\n2. Alexa will ask you which level do you want then store this value. Next time you start the skill it will just start playing the chosen level without asking.\n3. If you want to reset your choice, say: \"Alexa, ask memorize Quran to reset\"\n\nNote: You can also start it by saying: \u201cAlexa, ask memorize Quran to play level one\u201d\n\n---------------------------------------------\nCHAPTERS:\n---------------------------------------------\nYou can repeat a specific chapter (or Surah) instead of levels. The skill supports all the Surahs of the Quran (from 1 to 114)\n\n* How to play a specific chapter:\nYou can simply say: \u201cAlexa, ask memorize Quran to play chapter 70\u201d\n\n---------------------------------------------\n# Create a Routine!\nA great idea is to use Alexa Routine to schedule the levels to run every day in the morning and the evening.\nTo add this skill to a daily timer, follow these steps:\n1. Open your Alexa App.\n2. Select Routines.\n3. Select Schedule, add a time (say 7 AM).\n4. Choose Skills / Your Skills.\n5. Choose ' Memorize Quran '. Done.\n\nNote: When you start the skill it will run your last choice so you don\u2019t have to be around for the skill to run correctly in the routine.\n---------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: The skill content (the played Quran) is in Arabic.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
