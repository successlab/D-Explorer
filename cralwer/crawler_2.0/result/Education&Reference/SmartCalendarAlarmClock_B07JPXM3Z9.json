It then responds by TELLING the user what time to set an alarm, HOWEVER, it does NOT set the alarm itself.\nFuture implementation:\nReads off the calendar that the Alexa App has access to and then reads off the events. The alarm clock then CREATES an alarm on its own that is triggered when the time comes.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
