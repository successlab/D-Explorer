Alzheimer disease also spreads to dementia, which makes it a progressive condition. \n\nAlzheimer causes a person to loose intellectual functions, which are characterized by a variety of illnesses and symptoms, including degeneration. The brain tissues begin to deteriorate and collapse over time. In addition, Alzheimer disease affects the nerve tosses, which also deteriorate and erode gradually. \n\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease will gradually affect the mind to the point the patient becomes mentally less acute in the later stage. Senile causes the patient to forget and feel confused. Once maturity deficiencies increase, the problem leads to plague or epidemic buildup. In time the patient will loose microscopic strands of neurofibrillary, which occurs in cell bodies, dendrites, and axon, revolving around the nerve cells, concluding with tangling. \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease gradually moves to dementia, which is a cognitive, intellectual deterioration. The progressive disorder deteriorates the brain tissues increasingly, thus affecting the intellectual functions. The memory losses time, place, names, etc, which the actions causing dementia derive from brain complications whereas movement is uncontrolled, as well as senses are restrained. \n\nOver \u201c65%\u201d of the elderly people diagnosed with dementia have a mother disease called Alzheimer. The condition often affects people \u201c60\u201d years of age and older. The condition will target the age group 85 years and older, which more than \u201c30%\u201d are stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
