But not anymore! \nMrs. Clock is a straight-to-the-chase, time reading exercise, to help children learn the basics of telling time in a highly simplified format. The game breaks it down into three levels of complexity letting the players start with the easiest level that carries questions with simple one-hour time intervals, the minute hand always being on 12. As they catch on, they can move to fifteen and then to five-minute increments in the levels Medium and Hard respectively. To make it more challenging players are allowed to reduce wait time when answering questions. Beginners can grasp the concept of standard time reading by listening to the demo before starting the game. Traditional memorization techniques only go so far as to help kids fully assume the ability and build up to advanced levels of reading time. This game is specifically designed to give kids a full-stack visual and auditory learning experience by combining questions with voice cues on the position of clock hands, with vivid images of the clock face to imprint the perception of time in young minds. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve enabled this app on your Alexa device, just say \u201cAlexa, open Mrs.Clock\u201d and use the following commands: \n\nTo start playing, just say:\n\u201cStart the game\u201d\n\nTo choose a game level, say any of the following: \nEasy \nMedium \nHard\n\nTo switch from one game level to another, say:\nChange level\n\nTo learn the basic rules of reading time, say:\n\u201cdemo\u201d\n\nTo increase/reduce wait time when answering questions, say:\n\u201cMore time\u201d or \u201cReduce time\u201d\n\nTo enable/disable hints for questions, say:\n\u201cTurn on hints\u201d or \u201cTurn off hints\u201d\n\nTo erase your progress in the game and start over, say:\nReset the game\n\nTo understand the rules of the game, say \u201chelp\u201d.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
