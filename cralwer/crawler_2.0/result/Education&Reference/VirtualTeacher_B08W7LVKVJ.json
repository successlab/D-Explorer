The skill uses custom lists as attendance registers and calls out the names in turn just like a teacher would in a classroom. You can create a custom list in Alexa app via the mobile or web application and add names to the list like a register. You can then ask Virtual Teacher to take the morning register. Pupils record their attendance by simply saying \"here\" if they are present or \"absent\" or \"sick\" for those not present. The skill also provides simple attendance reports for the registers that have been recorded over the past week.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
