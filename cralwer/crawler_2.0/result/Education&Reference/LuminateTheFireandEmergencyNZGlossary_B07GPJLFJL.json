You're on the volunteer recruit programme. It's Tuesday night, you're at home and you're using your laptop to go through a module online. \n\nYou read a term that you're not familiar with. Instead of searching online for a glossary definition, you ask Alexa. Here's how it works:\n\nYou: Alexa, open Luminate\nAlexa: Welcome to Luminate. What term would you like me to explain?\nYou: What's a volt?\nAlexa: Volt. Measures electrical pressure represented by the symbol V. To listen to the explanation again, say repeat. What other term would you like me to explain?\nYou: Explain watts.\nAlexa: Watts. A unit of power, usually shortened to w. One thousand watts equals one kilowatt. To listen to the explanation again, say repeat. What other term would you like me to explain?\nYou: Close.\n\nWe're wired for speech; it's a natural way for us to ask questions and learn. So if you get stumped by a term or acronym, there\u2019s no need to Google, just ask Alexa and let Luminate guide you.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
