People donot know these basic terms and electricity plays a vital role in our lives. \n\nIt provides the fundamental definitions of basic terms used in electricity like current,voltage etc.\n\nIt works by entering a term which you want to know about by first saying \"open electrical geek\" then saying like \"what is current\" or \" what is meant by current\" etc.. Then it displays the definition of it and then says good bye.\nIf you want to know more then you should say again \"open electrical geek\" then you can search again.\n\nThe terms which can be searched are: \ncurrent\nvoltage\nresistance\ncapacitance\ninductance\ndiode\ntransistor\ngenerator\nmotor\npower\ndirect current\nalternating current\n\n\nAnd the ways to ask questions is:\n1) What is current\n2) what is meant by motor\n3) what's current\n4) what's meant by transistor\n\nIts a very simple skill to work on and very creative too.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
