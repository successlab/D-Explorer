Teachers and administrators observe and then input student behaviors into the Kickboard platform. The real-time, dynamic information is available through Kickboard\u2019s analysis tools and Alexa.\n\nThe Admin Kickboard skill allows school leaders to hear school-specific information on an Alexa enabled device by asking, \u201cAlexa, ask admin kickboard how can I improve school culture?\u201d Alexa will respond with information that describes the highest and lowest Kickboard teacher users according to the positivity ratio and the number of behaviors tracked. Also included in the response is the top student earners for the week, based on the total points or dollars the student has received in Kickboard and the students who have received the least number of points or dollars and may be in need of additional support.\n\nNeed help setting up or using the skill?
