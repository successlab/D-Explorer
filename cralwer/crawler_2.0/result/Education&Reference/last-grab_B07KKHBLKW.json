There are 20 color blocks in the grid. Each turn, you need to grab at least one block or grab as many blocks of the same color as you like. The player who grabs the very last block to fully reveal the picture in the grid wins the game. To start the game, say something like one block of blue to grab a blue block, or two blocks of purple to grab two purple blocks.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
