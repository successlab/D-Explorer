In 2014, the Monroe County Recycling Center began accepting Mixed Recycling - where all acceptable items can be mixed together. The addition of Mixed Recycling enabled the collection of recyclables in a one bin system, notably the rolling recycling carts provided by several local municipal and private collection companies.\n\nAdditionally, in 2011 Monroe County opened the Monroe County / Waste Management ecopark, a one-stop drop for many hard-to-recycle items.\n\nNOTE: Some recycling collection companies are not customers of the MCRC. Residential customers should always contact their collection company to confirm what is accepted and how recycling bins should be prepared.\n\nTo open this skill say, \"Alexa, open Monroe County Recycling\". You can then ask the skill for information about various things, for example\n\nAlexa, can I recycle electronics?\nAlexa, can I bring tires to the ecopark?\nAlexa, how do I recycle paint?\nAlexa, when is ecopark open?\nAlexa, where is the ecopark?\nAlexa, how can I get a new tot or bin?\nAlexa, can I recycle hazardous waste?\nAlexa, play the news.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
