This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: number tennis", "reviewnum": " 49", "des": "DESCRIPTION:\nNumber Tennis is a counting game for one to six players. All you need to do is count to 21 with Alexa. But, every time you get to 21 a new rule will be added to the game. For example, every multiple of 5 you need to say carrot instead of the number. If you also had a rule for every multiple of 10 you need to say potato, you would have to say carrot, potato for the numbers 10 and 20. The game can be played by one to six players. Tennis sounds will be used to indicate when it is your turn to speak. If you say 2 or 3 numbers at a time you will score more points and you can climb to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER MODE:\nYou will play with Alexa and take it turns to say a number in the sequence. Alexa is so clever, she always knows the correct answer. See how many levels you can complete and how complex you can make the game. Score more points and get to the top of the single player leaderboard.\n\nMULTIPLAYER MODE:\nThis is a team challenge. Each player will be given a character name, they need to remember who they are given. You will be chosen at random to say the next number in the sequence. Be warned it could go straight back to the same player. See how many levels you can complete. Score more points and get to the top of the multiplayer leaderboard. Good luck!\n\nTIPS:\n1) If you say an answer that is correct, but for some reason Alexa doesn't understand, you can shout \"ALEXA, CHALLENGE THAT!\" Then using some Eagle eye technology we can work out if what you said was correct. You get one free challenge a day.\n2) The game ends if you don't say anything after I prompt you for an answer. Your progress in the game will be lost. Just say \"I don't know\" if you can't think of anything to say.\n3) Get close to the device and keep background noise to a minimum. \n\nTHEMES:\nFruit and vegetables\nIce Cream Flavours\n\nCHARACTERS:\nMajor Piccolo Co - Cat\nLieutenant Whoopee Doo Doo - Dog\nColonel Honkey - Donkey\nCaptain CoCo Nutty - Monkey\nGeneral Squeakers - Mouse\nSergeant Quackerz - Duck\n\nEDUCATIONAL:\nThe game is designed to be fun but also a bit of a challenge for the brain.
