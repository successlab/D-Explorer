It has two different types of problems that it solves. For every path, you can solve the problem on any planet in the solar system.\nIf you would like to throw an object and have it hit a target, the skill will output the angles at which to hit the target. The user will input:\n1. x coordinate of the target\n2. y coordinate of the target\n3. velocity of the throw\nIf you throw an object and want it to return to the same height, there are three different outputs by the skill. \nIf you want to find the horizontal distance, you must input:\n1. The velocity of the throw\n2. The angle above the horizontal\nIf you want to find the angle of the throw, you must input:\n1. The velocity of the throw\n2. The horizontal distance traveled\nIf you want to find the velocity of the throw, you must input:\n1. The angle above the horizontal\n2. The horizontal distance traveled\n\nAll inputs and outputs are metric units.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
