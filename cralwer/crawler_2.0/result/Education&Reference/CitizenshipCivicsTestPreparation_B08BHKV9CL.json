Citizenship Civics Test. It is a study tool to help you test your knowledge of U.S. history and government. Use this tool to prepare for the civics portion of the naturalization test.\n\nWhat To Expect During The Real Test\nThe actual civics test is NOT a multiple-choice test. During the naturalization interview, a USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 questions from the list of 100 questions in English. You must answer correctly 6 of the 10 questions to pass the civics test.\n\nCertain applicants, because of age and time as a permanent resident, are exempt from the English requirements for naturalization and may take the civics test in the language of their choice. For more information, see our Exceptions and Accommodations page.\n\nTips For Studying\nOn the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or political appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to the questions. Answer these questions with the name of the official who is serving at the time of your eligibility interview with USCIS. The USCIS officer will not accept an incorrect answer.\n\nThe instructions and content in this practice civics test are not intended to provide legal advice or guarantee that you will pass the civics test during your naturalization interview. This test is just for practice!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
