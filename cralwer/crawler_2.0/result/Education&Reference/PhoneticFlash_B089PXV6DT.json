You will be shown the IPA representation, and prompted to pronounce the word. If you get it correct the first time, you score a point. If you don't get the word right (or in case Alexa misunderstands you), you can say \u201crepeat\u201d to try again, or \u201cnext\u201d to go to the next word. If you say \u201canswer\u201d, you will hear the correct word. If you say, describe, you will hear the named phonetic components of the word. At the end of each round, you can say \"play again\" to play at the same level, or choose a different word list (e.g. \u201cstart medium\u201d).\n\nYou can also ask to show the I.P.A. and hear the phonetic construction of any word in the vocabulary of nine thousand words.
