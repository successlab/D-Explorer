First-Year Seminars employ and develop a variety of skills including writing, speaking, critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and the use of technology or instrumentation.\n\nAll students in a First-Year Seminar live in the same residence hall, which provides them with an opportunity to integrate their academic and residential lives. This experience, alongside programming offered through the college\u2019s extended orientation program, offers students the opportunity of learning and working with other students and faculty on common educational interests and goals while deliberately fostering connections that support the transition to college.\n\nFirst-Year Seminars may include field trips, films, guest speakers, workshops, and community service projects. Many of these opportunities are designed for a specific seminar or group of related seminars.\n\nFirst-Year Seminars are focused on a professor\u2019s personal interest, presented in a way that invites discussion.\n\nThis skill allows you to search through Gettysburg's various seminars and find the one that best suits you.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
