This is a very useful tool at the workbench when you have your hands full but need to quickly do some resistor conversions without looking at table. \n\nSupports the first three colors of a three and four band resistor, and the two significant figures and the multiplier for other resistors. Simply put, for the most common resistors, the three and four band ones, just say the first three colors. For all others, say the first two and then fourth color. This skill presents the color code as the first two significant values and then the multiplier.
