These can then be retrieved by saying, for example, 'Ask Writer's Block for my saved words' or 'Ask Writer's Block for my stored rhymes for happy'.\n\nI hope you find the skill useful.\n\nThe skill uses the Datamuse API to find synonyms and rhymes (see https://www.datamuse.com/api for full details).", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
