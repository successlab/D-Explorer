To improve the listening experience, Daily Featured Article splits the article into discrete paragraphs and adjusts the text to make it more suitable for listening.\n\nTo listen to today's article, just open Daily Featured Article or ask Daily Featured Article to read today's digest.\nTo listen to articles from other dates, ask to read the article for a particular date. For example, eg ask Daily Featured Article to read yesterday's article; or ask for the article for July 1st, 2020.\nYou can also instruct Alexa to read articles from other days at any time from within the skill.\nIf you enjoy the articles, why not make listening to them part of your daily routine? Ask to set a daily reminder at any point.\nIf you get stuck, just ask for help.\n\nThis skill is not associated nor endorsed with the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
