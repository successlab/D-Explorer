At A.I. Haus, we foresee an A.I. revolution catering to the privileged, and that's why we're focused on making A.I. more accessible, especially to those at risk of being left behind. \n\nThis is where Georgie GPT comes in. As our very first published app, Georgie GPT is not just another variant of ChatGPT. We started by first optimizing her for voice only hands-free interaction (you can talk to her with your eyes closed). Next, we imbued her with unique features such as cross device conversation history, ability to 'speak Spanish', and personality settings (like 'be sarcastic'). She is also Free!\n\nGeorgie GPT up levels your A.I. conversations in unlimited ways. Invoke Georgie GPT on any Alexa enabled devices and apps... In your car(*)! In the shopping app(**)! Have her tell ghost stories at a party or even tell you a bedtime story with an ASMR voice! Ask her to 'speak Spanish'(***) so that you can ask the meanings of words and phrases in English and get answers in Spanish. \n\nJust say 'Alexa launch Georgie GPT' or 'Alexa ask Georgie GPT' followed by your question to get started! \n\nOther Details/Tips: \n\nLead with question words... \n\nConfigure her settings like 'ASMR Voice', 'Be Sarcastic', 'Speak Spanish', at anytime say 'Help for more commands and new options. \n\nAsk complex questions like: \n\n\"How can I determine if a metallic UFO in the sky is extraterrestrial in origin?\"\n\n\"What are some tips for avoiding being a dog water player in Fortnite?\"\n\n\"How can I configure the layout of my dealership to optimize for sales?\"\n\nLaunch Georgie GPT from within Amazon's shopping app and ask things like :\n\n\"Can you compare XYZ monitor to ABC monitor if I'm an avid gamer?\"\n\n\"Is expensive price of XYZ reasonable for these ABC wireless Bluetooth headphones?\"\n\n\"What are some gift ideas on Amazon.com for my father on father's day?\"\n\nAsk Georgie to create an email template. Make it funny. Make it serious. Make it professional. Retrieve it back for cut and paste via the Alexa mobile app. Customize Georgie's voice from expressive to whispering (ASMR), change her tone from sarcastic to funny, etc. Combine 'Whispering Voice' with 'Tell me a story about XYZ...' to have her tell whisper a spooky story to entertain your friends. Ask her to do it again but make the main character, you (or your dog)! \n\nHistory, Context and Persistence. Unlike other voice assistants, Georgie GPT is designed to retain the full context of your conversation, ensuring subsequent questions can build upon prior answers. In addition, Georgie persists your conversation from session to session and across devices, making sure that you can continue where you left off in a seamless flow of dialog. \n\nSocial Media!
