Whatever the age, there are certain physical things that you need to get ready for them to begin school. If your kids are like mine are, they have spent the summer with long nights and late mornings. Now that school is almost here, it\u2019s time to move back to an earlier schedule. If you have older children, this might be more difficult as you have less control over their schedule. But for younger ones, get started about three weeks before school starts by moving their sleep time up, and their wake up time up . Then the following week, move it up again. Continue this until your child is sleeping and waking during the same hours they will be when school starts. Find out more Back To School Tips and Advices , from our daily Flash Briefings.
