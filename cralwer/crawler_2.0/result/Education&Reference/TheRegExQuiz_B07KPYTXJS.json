Each quiz consists of five questions, such as \u201cwhat character will match the previous character zero or more times?\u201d. You then give your answers by saying the name of the character, in this case \u201casterisk\u201d or \u201cstar\u201d.\n\nThe RegEx Quiz is aimed at people who are either actively learning or are au fait with regular expressions. The quiz has been programmed from scratch by Software Engineer Geoff Hayward https://www.geoffhayward.eu with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience. The quiz has been well tested. And the questions have been rigorously researched. \n\nOnce you enabled the RegEx Quiz on your Alexa device, say \u201cAlexa, start the Regex Quiz\u201d. Answer each question out loud, just saying what you think the answer is. If you need to hear the question again, you can ask the quiz to \u201crepeat the question\u201d. If you have no idea what the answer is, just say \u201cpass\u201d, \u201cskip\u201d or \u201csausages\u201d.\n\nThe RegEx Quiz does not collect personal details. The RegEx Quiz does not include advertising. The quiz does promote the capabilities of RegEx Solutions http://regex.solutions/- a regular expressions writing service by Geoff Hayward (the quiz\u2019s author). \n\nPlease send issue reports, ideas for improvements and question suggestions using the contact form at https://www.geoffhayward.eu/message. \n\nThanks you for reading this description. Enjoy the RegEx Quiz.", "priv": ""}
