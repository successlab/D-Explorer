The information is stored in a digital format which is designed to be read by as many different platforms and readers as possible. The electronic book is produced through document scanning using an OCR program which reproduces text electronically to a high quality. Some are only electronically published and so have the text entered into the correct format immediately. The format of the ebook can differ and each format offers its own special features. Electronic books can produce a wide range of effects such as grey scale or colour images, annotations, video and music clips, tables and searchable information. The ebook is an exciting and functional way to produce and read interactive information. An ebook is made up of e-documents which each make up the pages. It is usually purchased for a low price and is then received immediately. And it is either received through an e-mail or downloaded from the web from a specified link. The electronic book is circulated by publishers, and can be sold in part, in sections or in full. Some publishers provide free samples of them so that readers can familiarize themselves with the format and usability as they are a relatively new concept for the general public.
