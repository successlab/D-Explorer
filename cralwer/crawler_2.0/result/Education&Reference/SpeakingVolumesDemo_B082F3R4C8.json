The Voice revolution has gone mainstream, led by Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and as of December 1, 2019, there were 200,000,000 installed smart speaker devices in American households. This is no fad, nor flash in the pan. This is a robust technological movement, and ChamberCentric\u2019s Speaking Volumes is your guide. This demo channel provides examples of the kind of content we regularly build for our chamber of commerce clients so that they may drive broader engagement in their respective communities. You see, chambers do all sorts of amazing things in their communities every day of the week, and those things matter. But the vast majority of the community simply doesn\u2019t know the chamber is behind so much of what chambers do. Speaking Volumes opens a brand new channel for chambers everywhere by providing the community, at-large, with compelling local, and meaningful content, on a daily basis through Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Listen here to sample an example of our stories.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
