Voice Learning helps you repeat the most important topics of your courses. Not by sitting in front of your computer or reading books, but just by talking.\n\nThe Voice Learning skill will ask you key questions and concepts, either as yes/no questions or multiple choice questions. After your answer, the skill will tell you if you were right. Voice Learning also keeps track of your progress and prioritizes questions you got wrong so that you can repeat them until you remember the right answer!\n\nThe skill was specifically developed for the University of Applied Sciences in St. P\u00f6lten, Austria. It contains questions for several of our courses. However, its code is completely open source - so it's easy for other universities or companies to adapt it to their own needs and feed in their own content!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
