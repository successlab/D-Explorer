That's around 6 to 10 minutes you have to sing (or speak) these lessons to your little one and have them fill in the blank. No music or smart speaker required - just mom or dad. But a little practice can help you remember the pattern. After a few weeks, you will probably be shocked when your little one starts properly identifying short words, which is a great foundation for early reading.\n\nWant to just hear what a complete drive time phonics song sounds like? Just say \"listen.\" If you're ready to practice the fill in the phonics game, just say \"practice\" and this lesson will pause the music when it's time for you to fill in the blank. \n\nPractice this fill in the blank song game and then try it with your early learner as you drive home from school or daycare.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
