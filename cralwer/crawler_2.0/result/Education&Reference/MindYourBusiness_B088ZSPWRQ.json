Being a businesswoman, CEO, serial entrepreneur, survivor, and general life enthusiast - I\u2019m endlessly jazzed by the business of life, especially the stories of extraordinary people I\u2019ve had the privilege to meet. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to keep that privilege to myself and I think you deserve to be utterly lifted and shifted by these people too. What sort of people? People from a variety of businesses, top entrepreneurs, actors, pro athletes, influencers, models, and the boy next door - but most importantly, all raw and fallible human beings who have persevered beyond extremes to become the successes they are today.\n\nYou can pause and play by saying \"Alexa, pause\" and \"Alexa, resume.\" Just say \"Alexa, stop\" when you're done for the day. When listening to podcasts you can say \"Alexa, shuffle\" to shuffle the playing order, or \"Alexa, loop\" to loop the current episode. You can also ask for previous and next episodes by saying \"Alexa, previous\" and \"Alexa, next\". \nYour requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
