In fact, oxygen is what we euphemistically call \u201cthe breath of life.\u201d But research has now established an astounding fact. The very thing that keeps us alive is the very same thing that\u2019s killing us. Are you properly shocked now?\n\nOxidation is the process by which we are continuously burning calories to produce energy for our cells to use in order to function. It is a necessary process and it is life-giving. However, scientists have now proved that this very process that enables us to live also releases dangerous and highly active molecules known as free radicals.\n\nFree radicals are the pervading cause of cell damage. They attack other cells, the cell walls, and genetic material within. Over a long period, such damage can become irreversible, leading to chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and other diseases associated with aging.\n\nThe one thing that can stop free radicals from completely damaging our tissues is the antioxidant. An antioxidant is a chemical that prevents the oxidation of other chemicals. In normal biological systems, free radicals have the tendency to attack healthy molecules around them and turn them into free radicals like themselves, creating a chain reaction which could lead to massive cellular damage. \n\nIt is the job of the antioxidant to keep free radicals from turning healthy molecules into free radicals. The antioxidant breaks off the free radical chain, thus preventing damage in the cells. In addition, antioxidants may also have properties that enable them to repair damages that might have been incurred.\n\nAntioxidants are found in various fruits and vegetables. \n\nLearn About Antioxidants from our short daily flash briefings. \n\nThis tool does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis.
