This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: der die das", "reviewnum": " 8", "des": "This skill will quiz the user on which article to use (der, die, or das) for a large list of German nouns. The user can select from several categories of words or get a random list across all categories. The list is kept in a database, so it is consistently growing. Please comment if there are specific words or categories that you'd like to see added! Note that since words are chosen at random, it is possible to get the same word multiple times in a session. Also, since the word selections are random, the user has a fresh experience each time the Skill is used. The user will be asked ten questions at a time before being prompted as to whether they would like to continue.\n\nPRACTICE MODE:\nUsage: Alexa, open der die das and enter practice mode.\nThe skill also keeps track and saves a list of words that a user gets wrong and allows the user to practice just those words in a practice mode. The more you use the skill, the more useful and powerful the practice mode becomes. Practice mode will keep words that were answered incorrectly in the list until the user demonstrates mastery by answering it correctly several times. \n\nOTHER FEATURES: \n- When the user answers with der, die, or das, the correct answer is repeated back in either a man's voice for der words or two different female voices for das and die. This gives the user another memory prompt to help associate each word with the proper gender.\n- When the user exits (either through the prompts or by saying \"Stop\" or \"I'm done\"), the user's score for this round is calculated and given to the user. \n\nCURRENT CATEGORIES:\n- Random\n- Abstract\n- Animals\n- Body\n- Clothes\n- Food\n- Household\n- Miscellaneous\n- Nature\n- People\n- Sports\n- Transportation", "priv": ""}
