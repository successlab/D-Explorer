In the first column, you need to put the name of the items. In the second, the location. all in lowercase. And that is it! It automatically syncs with your drive.\n\n You can see a sample sheet in here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/sciencefamily/sciencemom.png\n You can share the sheet if your lab members. If you have authorized the app and you can see changes\u2026 then the Science Mom can see them too! (but only to the \u201cScience Mom \u201d sheet)\n\n By using the skill, you are authorizing the app to get the names of the files in your drive (but not the content!) and to read spreadsheets. The only spreadsheet it reads is the one named \u2018Science Mom \u2019. So, don\u2019t worry, we are not putting your files at risk :) \n\n If you want to give feedback or report bugs, you can reach out to lubianat@ime.usp.br.

Feel free to build upon the idea!\n This skill was built by @lubianat at the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (http://csbiology.com/) and is part of a suite of skills called \u2018Lab Family\u2019.\n\n Each skill is independent of the others, and they are meant to improve daily life in molecular biology laboratories. Of course, you are free to use them anywhere you like!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
