The full test includes 50 video clips and 50 audio clips. For each clip, you will be given four words, and asked to pick which word best describes the emotion portrayed by the actor. During the test, you can ask for any clip to be repeated or any emotion defined. At the end of the test, you will be given a score, and a chance to review any of the specific emotions portrayed. You can also take a short test (12 videos and 12 audios) or a practice test (two videos and two audios).\n\nThe face/video portion of the test requires a device with a display screen. Audio only devices will include the voice/audio portion of the test. \n\nOptions:\nBy default, scoring is displayed during the test. To display a running score, say \u201cScoring On\u201d at any time, or \u201cScoring Off\u201d to turn off score reporting.\nBy default, answer feedback is provided. To hear answer feedback, say \u201cAnswers On\u201d at any time, or \u201cAnswers Off\u201d to turn off feedback.\nAfter viewing or hearing a clip you can ask for the clip to be repeated by saying \u201cRepeat\u201d.\nIf you need a definition for one of the words, say \u201cDefine\u201d followed by the word.\nAt the end of the test, you will be given a list of missed words and definitions to review. To see and hear the clips that demonstrate those words, say \u201cReview\u201d followed by the word.\n\nAdditional help is sent to your Alexa app. \n\nFor more information, please refer to: Golan, O., Baron-Cohen, S., & Hill, J.
