For example, you can say:\n- New York City\n- Korea\n- Eiffel Tower\n- Egypt\n- Australia\n- Antarctica\n- Airport\n- Great Wall of China\n- Niagara Falls\n- Stadium\n- Beach\n\nOr say \"Random\" to see a random one! \n\nYou cay say \"SlideShow\" to see a slideshow of random web cams, which is really fun!\n\nBest of all, if there is a webcam you really like, you can say \"Set Favorite\" to mark that webcam as your favorite. Then each time you start the skill or say \"Show my Favorite\" it will show that webcam and even periodically update it on your screen!\n\nAll images are continually being updated, so you always see the most recent, newest one on your Echo device screen, along with its exact location. And, Alexa will tell you the name of the location as well as how recently the image was taken. \n\nIt's amazingly enjoyable and even a bit addictive, to watch these images from all around the world!!\n\nNote: Occasionally a webcam will be down and show a blank image - try again a few hours later and typically it is back up again.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
