You can also ask information about earthquakes that might have occurred near New Zealand\u2019s six largest cities.*\n\nFollowing certain GeoNet information, EQC and Civil Defence tips are provided to help you prepare your homes and yourself for various natural hazards.\n\nWe welcome your comments and suggestions on this Skill. Please leave these below.\n\nWHICH EARTHQUAKES WILL BE REPORTED?\n\nThe skill will provide information about earthquakes that happened in the last three days.\n\n- Earthquakes with MMI 6 and above will be reported regardless of your location. \n- Earthquakes with MMI 5 will be reported if they happened within 200km of the location queried.\n- Earthquakes 3 and 4 will be reported if they happened within a 100km radius. \n- Earthquakes with MMI lower than 3 won't be reported by the skill.\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nThis Skill does not provide natural disaster warnings. In the possible event of a tsunami, remember: if you are near the coast and feel an earthquake that is LONG or STRONG: GET GONE. Don\u2019t wait for official warnings.\n\n* Depending on uptake, we hope to expand this Skill to include additional New Zealand locations and hazard types. We currently support Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, Tauranga and Dunedin for direct queries. The addition of information for natural hazards other than earthquakes (e.g. storms) may also be included at a later time.\n\nGeoNet is a collaboration between the Earthquake Commission and GNS Science.\n\nThis Skill will not have, or provide, access to any of your personal information.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
