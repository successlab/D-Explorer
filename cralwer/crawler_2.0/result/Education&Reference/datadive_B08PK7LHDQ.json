Scaled values are shown in a display that tracks your location and heading through the 3D space. The data points are mapped as small spheres in space.\n\nInstructions include:\n1) \"go\" to move forward\n2) \"full stop\" to stop the changing location\n3) \"scan\" to list data points in your viewport\n4) \"labels on\" (or \"off\") to label data points with their row number from the CSV\n\nYou can \"turn\" left or right or up or down. You can also say, \"go to\" a row number to jump to a specific data point's location. You can also \"roll\" left or right if you want to change your perspective.\n\nYou can turn off the displays or the compass if you want. They are off by default for very small screens.\n\nThis skill is much harder to use without a display!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
