This skill contains: dynamic content.\nDeveloper Terms of Use", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "In these days of competitive markets, the business that excels at customer service is the one that will not only maintain their position, but grow. You could answer the question \"What is Customer service\" by saying that it is about \"exceeding\" the expectations of the client, not just \"satisfying\" them. This is not just about the product or service that you are selling; it's about looking after the people buying them from you too.\n\nHaving a great product must be the first step. Everybody likes quality, even more if it is competitively priced with other similar products. \n\nIf you make the product yourself, see what you can do to enhance how it performs, what it's made from, how it compares with others. If you can make the product the best there is within the price range, customers will not only buy from you, but they will recommend others to buy from you too.\n\nSo, you have a great product and your client base is growing - how is your pre and after sales service doing? Not many people think about how they sell the product, but it is still literally serving the customer. How many of us have put the phone down on someone who has been given the unenviable task of cold calling clients to try and sell goods? \n\nCold calling and pressure sales are two areas that have managed to give selling a bad name, particularly if they are persistent, repetitive and quite obviously so desperate to make a sale that they become aggressive. This is most definitely not what is customer service. Most of us would prefer to do our own market research when looking to buy something and the Internet has made it all so much easier. \n\nIf you want to build your client base, having a website is now essential rather than an optional extra. Customers can look at the product, find out more about it and then contact you if they are interested. If they register with your site, you are able to build a list of potential customers too, to contact them again at a later date.\n\nThe information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only.\n\nLearn About Affiliate Marketing Skill is part of allsuper.info's free informational network.\n\nFor more content like this, visit : https://learnforfree.biz/", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
