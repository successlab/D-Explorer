It guides users through a series of daily exercises based on the Go4Life program developed by the National Institute on Aging (https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). Routines change daily (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun routine, Tues/Thur/ Sat routine) to target different muscles. Users are started on a very low intensity program which is automatically adjusted to a higher intensity based on user feedback of exercise difficulty to encourage growth.EngAGE Disclaimer Please consult your doctor before participating in the exercises. It is particularly important to first discuss exercise with your doctor if you are 70 years of age or older, have had a heart attack in the last 6 months or have on-going chest pain, if you have heart arrhythmias, aneurysms, aortic valve stenosis, high blood pressure, have had a blood clot, severe lung or breathing problems, heart failure, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes or low blood sugar problems, if you have had problems with low blood pressure or feel dizzy when you stand, if you have had a bone fracture, have recent or active infections that have affected your general condition or any other condition that limits your ability to do exercise. People participating in this program will all initially be enrolled in the lowest intensity program to reduce the risk of having any new symptoms appear as a result of exercise. The program will automatically adjust the intensity of the exercises, up or down, based on your rating of how difficult you feel each exercise is. Should you feel significant pain, breathlessness, chest pain, dizziness, light-headedness or any other symptom that is concerning to you, stop all exercises and consult your doctor immediately.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
