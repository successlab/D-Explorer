But mere repetitive and mind-numbing practice could actually harm your motivation. To speak better German quickly one needs controlled and intelligent speaking practice.\n\nIn the smarterGerman online German course you\u2019ll get to know a very powerful technique which helps you not only memorize complex grammatical structures in a refreshingly easy way but also recall the information when you need it most. \n\nYou\u2019ll build up muscle memory by speaking out loud so that later on, when you finally get to use your German in real life, you won\u2019t stumble over your own tongue that much but actually sound fluent.\n\nThis skill is the speaking partner you have been looking for since you started to get a grasp of the awful German language - thanks Mark Twain. Alexa is 100% patient, incredibly precise in her feedback and 24/7 at your disposal.\n\nAll you need is an Amazon Echo device which costs less than a single lesson with a professional German tutor. Just that you do get unlimited lessons with Alexa. \n\nPlease keep in mind that the Preaching technique is only one of many powerful self-learning techniques which you can find in my Everyday German Online Course (A1-B1).\n\nFor available commands in German, switch to German locale.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
