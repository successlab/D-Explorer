In response to feedback, Alexa now reads at a slower pace. \n\nWhether you didn't make it to Mass this week, or you just want time for some spiritual reflection, Catholic Daily provides a piece of the Mass to you from the convenience of your Alexa-enabled device. Hear all of a day's readings or just the gospel direct from the Roman Catholic Lectionary for Mass. Catholic Daily works every day, from Sundays to weekdays. It can deliver the readings to you faithfully in every liturgical season, from Advent to ordinary time. Listen to readings from today or a date of your choosing. \n\nWe are committed to providing a positive user experience. Our database is manually curated and it will take some time for the entire lectionary to be completed. If the skill does not return a reading for a particular day, please notify us at the email at the bottom of our the Privacy Policy and we'll address it right away. Got a feature request?
