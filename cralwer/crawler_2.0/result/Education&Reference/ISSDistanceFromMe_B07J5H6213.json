Well, me too. One \"thing\" I've always been interested in is the International Space Station because humans actually live up there. Satisfy your curiosity by saying \"Alexa, ask Space Station how far away it is\" to receive the real-time distance between you and the ISS.\n\nThank you for your interest in space!\n\nNOTE: For this skill to work, you'll have to enable device location permissions. The device location that will be used in the distance calculation is whatever you have manually input as the device location. Please ensure that the address is accurate.\n\nIf you have any feedback, suggestions, or general concerns please reach out to our team at contact@sublimitylabs.com!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
