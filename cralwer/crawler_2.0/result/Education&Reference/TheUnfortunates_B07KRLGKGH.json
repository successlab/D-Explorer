The Unfortunates stars Martin Freeman (famous for The Hobbit & Sherlock) in a dramatisation of the cult 1960s novel by B.S Johnson, adapted by the BBC.\n\nJohnson's experimental book was famously published in a box as a collection of loose chapters, designed to be shuffled into a new order every time it was read. It follows a sports journalist whose memories of a dead friend are triggered when he goes to a football match, touching on the themes of love and loss.\n\nIn this adaptation, hear the \u2018chapters\u2019 played in an order that changes each time. Plus delve deeper with a documentary about avant-garde fiction in the 1960s and a behind-the-scenes interview with the creators of this skill.\n\nThe Unfortunates is a BBC R&D production with Radio 3 and released by BBC Taster.\n\nIt contains some adult themes and some sexual content.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
