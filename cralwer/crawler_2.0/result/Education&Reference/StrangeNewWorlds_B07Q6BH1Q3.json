Start with tours of famous, habitable, and earth-like exoplanets, all from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The skill tells you about the planet and whether it might support life. If you have a display, Alexa will show you concept art matching the planet to help you imagine what it would be like to explore it. After that, use web searches like \"best Kepler exoplanet discoveries\" to get a list of planets for Alexa to find. Once you have visited an exoplanet, you can visit its star or explore its system to visit other planets in its star system. Astronomers have located thousands of exoplanets -- they are out there waiting for you to discover them.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
