You can choose to do as many as you like each day. After each phrase you can say \"Next\", \"Previous\" or \"Repeat\". You can also say \"Tell Me\" to get the English translation, and ask me to \"Speak Slower\". I can't check your translation, but I will show the phrase on the Alexa companion App. \n\nTo restart the lessons from the beginning say \"Start Over\", or else tell me to \"Go To\" a phrase number you have already completed. Say \"Setup\" if you want to go to configuration to choose a new language.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
