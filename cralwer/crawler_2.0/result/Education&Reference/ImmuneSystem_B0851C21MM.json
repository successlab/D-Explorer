Then this immune system nanolesson can help you learn a little more faster. \n\nIn this nanolesson you'll review clues to help strengthen basic knowledge of macrophages, neutrophils, B cells, T cells and mucus, while helping your monster fight a cut, a dust storm, some germs and an infection. If you win, go ahead and reward yourself with a jelly bean or an apple.\n\nImage (icon) Source:\n\nTitle: Dendritic cell revealed Description: Artistic rendering of the surface of a human dendritic cell illustrating sheet-like processes that fold back onto the membrane surface. When exposed to HIV, these sheets entrap viruses in the vicinity and focus them to contact zones with T-cells targeted for infection. These studies were carried out using ion abrasion scanning electron microscopy, a new technology we have been developing and applying for 3D cellular imaging.
