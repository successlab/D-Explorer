Much of what happened to Canada's indigenous people were \u201cswept under the rug\u201d by the Canadian government and Canadian people. Ignorance and bias exist due to a lack of education or empathy to see native Canadians as fellow human beings/citizens. Not unique to Canadians, misinformation, and confusion exist for immigrants to Canada because they have no way of learning about indigenous people or their history. Worsening the problem is the reserves, acting like a ghetto the reserves segregate the indigenous people to sections of land that are far away from Canadian cities often from centers of activity. They are vastly underserviced by the Canadian government.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
