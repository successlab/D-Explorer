On December 24th NORAD conducts a special mission tracking Santa across the globe and keeping him safe. Find out how many days are left until Santa begins his yuletide journey, follow him as he gets ready the day before his flight and hear his location as we track him across the globe on December 24th. You can also get facts from the Top-Secret Santa files. Only Santa knows when he will arrive at your house, but we do know he only arrives when children are asleep.\n\nMore information about NORAD tracks Santa is available on NORAD Santa Tracker website.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
