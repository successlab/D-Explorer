The game teaches the new words to kids in increasing order of complexity i.e. starting with simpler words. Game is adaptive in nature i.e. it remembers the words that kids have already used during the game; using that memory game encourages the kids to learn new words instead of repeating the same old word again and again. Also in learn mode game ensures that kids are taught new words instead of the words that they have already used.\n\nAt the start of the game, child is informed of the total number of unique words spoken by the child and also the child's rank in the game including the performance of all children. The more unique words the child speaks the more the ranking of the child improves. Rank 1 is the best rank , greater the number of rank lower is the ranking or performance of child. \n\nSkill will start by using any of the following phrases\n'Alexa, start abc'\n'Alexa, open abc'\n'Alexa, launch abc'\n\nSkill will then give option to the user to\n- Learn All letters by saying 'LEARN' or 'LEARN ALL'\n- Learn individual letters by saying LEARN followed by any letter, as an example 'LEARN D', 'LEARN T' or 'LEARN A' or any valid combination \n- Play with letters and words by saying 'PLAY'. \nkids can use these options one after the other, as many times as they want.\n\nIn LEARN ALL mode Alexa will speak out words for all English alphabets one by one starting from A to Z. When learning specific letter Alexa will speak words for only that Letter. Alexa remembers the words that child has already used in PLAY mode, those words are not repeated in the learn mode again, hence allowing for more learning & vocabulary building for kids. \n\nIn Play mode, Alexa will ask word for English alphabets, by prompting 'A For'. Kids are supposed to respond with any of the common English words starting with letter A. If word is found to be incorrect, skill will prompt user for one more try. Also if child repeats the same word more than twice that may not be allowed.\n\nIf word is found to be correct. Skill will continue and ask for next letter i.e. 'B For' and likewise the game will continue and will end with letter 'Z' once the kid has responded correctly with words for all English alphabets. \n\nAlexa will help on its own in case kid gives incorrect responses twice for the same letter. Also kids can take help any moment by saying 'HELP' to Alexa, then Alexa will help back by speaking words for that letter.\n\nOnce kid has completed all letters, Alexa will revise all letters where either there were mistakes or where help was given.\n\nIn Play mode, game has a PAUSE feature, so at any letter kids can simply say 'PAUSE', the game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again. \n\nLikewise in Play mode, if child misses to respond to skill's prompts and game stops. In this case also, game will record the letter where child was and next time if the game is restarted within two hours it will resume from that letter instead of starting from A again. \n\nThe word list that skill uses contains only the common words as per primary standard. This list is very rich and is continuously updated. In case more complex words are spoken the skill will recognize them. But when in learn mode the skill will only teach the words from its own list, these words are more suitable for small children. Also game arranges its list in increasing order of complexity, so simpler words are taught first followed by difficult ones.\n\nBest of Luck Kid! Good fun and great learning to you!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
