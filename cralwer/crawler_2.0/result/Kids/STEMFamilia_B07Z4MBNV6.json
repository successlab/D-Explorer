The skill is designed to help elementary English learner students and their families acquire the specific vocabulary and language skills that support STEM learning and success. \n\nSTEM Familia contains 18 sequential 12-minute lessons. Each lesson targets a single word. To facilitate a dual-language experience, all directions, commentary, and feedback is delivered by a bilingual narrator via the skill\u2019s embedded audio files. Each instructional activity is delivered first in Spanish and then in English. Questions that call for a Spanish language response trigger general feedback that reinforces users\u2019 effort and offers a statement of the correct response. Users\u2019 English language responses trigger specific feedback, with reinforcement for correct answers or corrective feedback for incorrect answers. \n\nTo initiate the skill, users say, \u201cAlexa, Open STEM Familia.\u201d A narrator delivers an introductory message in Spanish welcoming families and providing directions about how to access the three possible paths for engagement. \n\nPath 1-\u201cNew word\u201d allows users to access a word lesson. \nPath 2- \u201cReview words\u201d allows users to review abbreviated lessons of previously learned words.\nPath 3-\u201cRepeat word\u201d allows users to repeat a specific word lesson. A follow up prompt asks users to specify which word they would like to repeat. \nAs users complete word lessons, they advance to the next target word lesson.\n\nWord lessons.\nGame 1/new word: When users initiate a new lesson, they hear skill\u2019s narrator giving instruction on the new word (La nueva palabra es \u2018evidencia\u2019/The new word is \u2018evidence\u2019). The narrator then poses a question to test users\u2019 knowledge (\u00bfCual es la nueva palabra?/What is the new word?). Users\u2019 responses trigger general feedback in Spanish (Muy bien! La nueva palabra es \u2018evidencia\u2019!) or specific feedback in English (Yes, the new word is \u2018evidence\u2019/ Good try! The new word is \u2018evidence\u2019.) \n\nGame 2/definition: A similar instructional sequence in used for the target word\u2019s definition. Users are given instruction in the target word\u2019s meaning, asked to generate the target word\u2019s meaning, and then given general or specific feedback based on their response. \n\nGame 3/spelling: Users are given instruction on how to spell the target word, then asked to spell the target word. Generic feedback is provided in Spanish and English. \n\nGame 4/usage: To practice usage, users are asked to complete a sentence using the target word and receive general or specific feedback based on their responses.\n\nGame 5/synonyms: Users are taught a common synonym for the target word, tested on their ability to recall the synonym, then provided with generic or specific feedback.\n\nGame 6/meaning verification game: Users listen to sentences with the target word and are asked to verify (si/no, yes/no) if the correct word meaning is reflected in the sentence.\n\nGame 7/complete sentence usage: Users are asked to repeat full sentences that include the target word. \n\nModeling vignettes: Following a brief review of the target word\u2019s meaning and spelling, users listen to a 30-second Spanish language audio vignette in which a parent and child model an interaction using the target word. \nUsers then hear a 30-second English language audio vignette in which the same student and his/her teacher interact using the target word in an academic context. \n\nConclusion: Users hear a Spanish language parting message encouraging them to use the target word in family conversations.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
