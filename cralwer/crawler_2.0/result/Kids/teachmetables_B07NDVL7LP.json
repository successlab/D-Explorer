It then displays and recites the first five items from that table. It will ask the user to memorize them and once they are ready, it tests their memory with a short quiz. It congratulates kids using funny voices when they get it right, and when they get it wrong, it makes funny sounds and tells them the correct answer.\n\nFor every correct answer, it assigns 10 points and the score is tracked through out the session to keep kids engaged. Once the first half of the table is completed, it then goes on to teach the rest of the table using similar techniques. \n\nThis skill is developed based on a real life, proven teaching techniques used to teach kids master their math times tables.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
