So, here is a simple, yet powerful way to achieve it. Now, this trick is being scientifically proven in the most prestigious Institute of Medical Science of India, AIIMS. The research work was carried out for the last 20 years. Before going deep into what Gayatri Mantra means and unravel its magical benefits. It\u2019s important to know the meaning of Mantra first.\nMantra is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit believed by practitioners to have psychological and /or spiritual powers.\nThe earliest mantras were composed in Vedic Sanskrit in India, and are at least 3000 years old. Mantras now exist in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In the Japanese Shingon tradition, the word Shingon means mantra. Similar hymns, antiphons, chants, composition, and concepts are found in Zoroastrianism, Taoism, Christianity and elsewhere.\nThis mantra should be chanted with closed eyes and with full devotion. Usually 12, 24 or 108 times one can chant. The preferred time for chanting is before noon that is in the morning or in Sandhya Kaal (one hour after sunset).\nAIIMS has recently confirmed it through the research of the brain activation by MRI, that on chanting Gayatri Mantra over a period of time it expands the Prefrontal cortex of the brain. It was conducted on men of 25 -30 years for a period of 9 months and after that, data was studied for 5 years. It was observed that there are remarkable changes in the brain especially in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. The work of this part is to make a plan, solve problems and to be aware. Those who were reciting the mantras were releasing a chemical called GABA, lack of this chemical causes sleep deprivation and depression-like diseases.\n\nUsage\nUser: Alexa, open Gayatri mantra\nAlexa: Starting Gayatri mantra for kids, please say start or begin\nUser: Start\nAlexa: Plays the Audio\n\nYou can always play, resume, pause, stop next or previous and move according to the audio streams.\n\nThe skill plays audio in Hindi.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
