Now it includes a variety of capabilities designed to allow different retail formats to fully digitize their customer interactions. The core platform involves an application for shoppers and a separate application for staff that mediates shopping, customer service, and promotions. The shopper application comes in two flavors: Universal, for use by multiple smaller retailers, and Private White-label, for larger brands. Additional capabilities include product marketing, order-ahead counter service, and a special loss prevention system that is more secure than a standard checkout lane.", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
