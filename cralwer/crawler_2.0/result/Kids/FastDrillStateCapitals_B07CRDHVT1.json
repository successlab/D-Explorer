In this skill, Alexa will go through each state alphabetically, give the student 3 seconds to name the state capital before she does. Alexa then moves to the next state. This allows students to practice as many times as they need - or hear as many times as they need to hear - the information. It is perfect for preparing for quizzes, tests or exams, contests - or impressing friends.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
