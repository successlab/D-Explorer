Thanks.\n\nWe have updated the skill with a more smooth and fault-free experience. We are continuing the legacy of the previous skill with a more advanced and smooth voice experience.\n\n\nBecause the English language has more than 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds(or phonemes) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs. An alphabet song is any of various songs used to teach children the alphabet. Alphabet songs typically recite the names of all letters of the alphabet of a given language in order.\n\nSteps for using the skill:\n\nSession 1:\nUser: Alexa, open alphabet song\nAlexa: Starting alphabet song, you can say start or begin\nUser: Start / Begin\nAlexa: Playing alphabet song\nUser: Alexa, next\nUser: Alexa, stop\nUser: Alexa, shuffle\nUser: Alexa, next / previous\nUser: Alexa, resume\nUser: Alexa, start over\nUser: Yes/No\n\n\nSession 2:\nUser: Alexa, open alphabet song\nAlexa: You were listening to the alphabet song already, Would you like to resume?\nUser: No\nAlexa: <Alexa starts over to play the audio from start> You are listening to the alphabet song rhyme.
