Also, double the questions for each country means you can explore countries multiple times. Earn gold doubloons and tickets to play our exciting new mini-game called \"Who, What, Where?\" with each country you travel through.\n\nSPECIAL: Use the doubloons you earn to take part in our limited-edition events and make sure you earn enough to grab each of our collectible characters unique to Travel Quest. The Samurai Warrior, Cleopatra, Athena, and the Roman Gladiator are now available with more characters coming soon.\n\nDesigned for kids 13 and under, yet fun for adults, too. This skill is an adventure-styled travel exploration game. A unique passport is created for each member of the household that wants to play. Once you have a passport, you are given a choice of countries to explore.\n\nExploring a country allows you to learn about the cuisine, geography, landmarks, leaders, events, festivals and even more in a fun way. Answering simple questions allows you to explore the country further. When you finish exploring a country, you get gold doubloons, a ticket to play our bonus game, \"Who, What Where?\", and a chance of leveling up.\n\nCurrent countries include: Japan, Canada, France, Brazil, Egypt, Australia, Guatemala, Italy, Greece, Tunisia and Turkey. Iceland and other countries coming soon! \n\nGive us feedback and let us know which countries and special events you want next. Also, if you had fun and learned, please consider giving us a review!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
