If you do then continue reading.\n\nPositive affirmations are phrases/beliefs used to challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts. As children learn behaviours and wire their brain, affirmations are very useful for developing a child's self belief. Every one of us has a strong belief system about the world and ourselves. This was learned from the environment around us. Positive words can help shape this belief system.\n\nFor example, if your affirmation is \"when I fail, I say I can't do it YET, and try again\", and you fail at something, the affirmation will trigger in your brain and remind you that you can do it, you just need to keep trying. Without this positive affirmation, you might think that if you fail at something then you can never do it and will just give up without trying again.\n\nSimply ask Alexa to get todays positive words for your child.
