Great for kids, but fun for anyone. Start by saying \"Alexa, open Guess Me\" and she will let you guide you through the game. You can say \"help\" at any time if you run into trouble and also tips on how to guess the answer. Remember that a parent needs to add permission in the Alexa app to use this skill! You should get a prompt upon your first invocation. I hope you have fun and enjoy playing.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
