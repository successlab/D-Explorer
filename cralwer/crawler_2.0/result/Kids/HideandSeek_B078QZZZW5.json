To do that I sent some information....\":\n1. Open the Alexa app.\n2. Click 'home'.\n3. Refresh (drag down from the center of the screen). \n4. Click 'Give Permission'. This will open the skill page. \n5. Disable the skill, then enable again and follow the instructions below.\n\n\nIf you ***haven't enabled the skill yet***:\n1. Enable the skill on the app (find the skill by searching, click 'Enable To Use').\n2. If a sign in page opens, log in to amazon with your regular password (this might not happen if you are recently logged in).\n3. The next screen should say \"Your permission will apply to the following profiles: ...\" and your profile should appear just above the 'Continue' button.\n4. If you want to add permissions for kids click 'Add Child' and add a child accounts.\n5. If **your** profile doesn't appear, it's possible Amazon thinks you are the child on the family account (age is irrelevant, you can stay young forever!). \n You can try adding yourself, or calling Amazon customer service.\n6. Click 'Continue'.\n7. Verify you're an adult. Amazon may ask you to add a credit card to verify you are an adult. You'll need to add a credit card and billing address. \n If you already added a credit card you might just need to input the cvv number again.\n8. Read the 'Parental Consent' text, click 'I agree'.\n9. You should see 'Thank You. Your parental consent has been saved. Your skill has been enabled. ... You can close this window by pressing \"x\" at the top.'\n10. After you close the window you should see 'Enabling skill...' that eventually turns into 'Disable Skill' once the skill is enabled.\n11. That's it, you should be able to use the game now.\n\n\n**** If anything goes wrong, or you are not sure about these instructions, please give Amazon customer service a call.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this game.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
