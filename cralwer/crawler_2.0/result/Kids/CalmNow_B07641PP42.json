Whether it's anger or sadness, this Alexa skill, Calm Now, walks through proven calming techniques such as taking deep breaths, counting to 10, and shaking out your legs like you have a whole bunch of fire ants in your pants. Although originally targeted to kids, we've also found this skill to be helpful for some adults we know (not naming names). \n\nIdeally kids using this skill will learn the techniques so well that eventually they can calm themselves down without the help of Alexa. Ideally adults using this skill will also find it helpful, while appreciating its playful nature.\n\nMusic from Pond 5.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
