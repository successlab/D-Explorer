This version is completely redone from the ground up, attempting to enhance but maintain the spirit of the original game in a voice-only experience.\n\nThis game skill simulates owning a lemonade stand. Alexa states the weather forecast for the (simulated) day and then the player buys cups of lemonade to sell, buys signs for advertising, and sets a price for a cup of lemonade. The skill provides clear instructions what's expected of the player.\n\nThe game goes on forever. You will earn \"experience badges\" as you accumulate playing time and earn money selling lemonade.\n\nThis is a great game for children, parents to play with their children or educators in a classroom. The game focuses on the following player skills: careful listening, math, money, business, understanding odds and chance statements, and managing expectations.\n\nAt any time you can ask \"what's the weather\" or say \"tell me the weather\" to have Alexa repeat the weather forecast.\n\nYou can find out how much money you've earned by asking \"how much do I have\" or \"how much money do I have\". To have the simulated game day number repeated, you can ask \"what day is it\" or \"what's the day\".\n\nTo see what badges you've earned, say \"Alexa, badges\".\n\nYou can ask for contextual help by saying \u201cAlexa, help\u201d, immediately go to the next simulated day by saying \u201cAlexa, next day\u201d, or stop the game by saying \u201cAlexa, stop\u201d or \"Alexa, cancel\" to end your game.\n\nYour current scores and badges are saved unless you reset your game or disable the skill.\n\nYou will start with five dollars. If you go under two dollars, you will automatically be bumped back up to five.\n\nIf you want to reset your game to the beginning (without disabling the skill and enabling it again), you can say \"Alexa, clean slate\" and then repeat the magic words Alexa tells you to say.\n\nTip: When you say a price for a cup of lemonade, include the words \"dollars\" and \"cents\" where appropriate. Good examples are, \"a dollar\", \"a dollar twenty-five\", \"two dollars and twenty-five cents\", \"seventy-five cents\".", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
