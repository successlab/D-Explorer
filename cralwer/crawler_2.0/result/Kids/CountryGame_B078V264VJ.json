You say a country name. Example: 'Sweden'. Then, Alexa says a country name starting with the last letter of the previously spoken country name. Example: 'Netherlands' (starts with 'N' since 'n' is the last letter in 'Sweden'). This goes on and on until you or Alexa cannot think of an answer. You can also say 'Pass' if you get stuck in which case 100 points are deducted from your score and the game continues. If Alexa loses, your score increments by 1000 points. You also earn points if 6 countries are spoken back to back in a single game.\n\nThe game also randomly educates you about countries by telling a fun fact about them during the course of the game. For ex : if you say 'Netherlands', it may tell you a fun fact about it like \"Did you know that around 20% of Netherlands is located below sea level?\".\n\nThis skill keeps a score of your performance based on the number of countries you say in a game. You can also query your worldwide rank by saying 'Whats my rank?'.\n\nWhile this game is targeted for children under 13, it can very well be enjoyed by adults. Primary school teachers in schools may also consider making this game part of their classes to teach students about various countries.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
