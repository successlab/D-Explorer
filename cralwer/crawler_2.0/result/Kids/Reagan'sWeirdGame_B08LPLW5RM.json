To learn more just ask \"Alexa, what are Echo Buttons?\" \n \nGet two to four contestants together to star in this game show! In each round, Alexa will ask a question. Players will buzz in with their Echo Buttons to answer. As you play, Alexa will let you know if you're right or wrong and track your score. The contestant with the most correct answers wins!\n \nWhile playing, you can say \"Alexa, repeat that\" to hear Alexa read the question again. You can also say, \"Alexa, what are the scores?\" to hear a score report. You can say, \"Alexa, help!\" to hear about what you can do next. You can say, \"Alexa, start over\" if you want to abandon the current game and pick up from the beginning. At any time you can say, \"Alexa, stop\" to halt the current game. If you had already started a game, Alexa will remember where you stopped and pick back up from the last question asked, when you next launch the skill.\n\nThis skill was created using a Skill Blueprint.
