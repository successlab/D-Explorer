Based on the card that Player selects, the Dealer will give a SPECIFIC command to \"guess\" the card. For example, if the Player selected the Ace of Clubs, the Dealer would say, \u201cWhat card was chosen? Alternatively, if Player selected the Two of Clubs, the Dealer would say, \"Which card was selected?\"\n\nHow did the dealer know what to say?
