The Dealer will then ask the ToyBot to reveal the card. Here\u2019s the magic: Based on what the dealer says, the card will change. For example, if the player selects the Ace of Clubs, the Dealer would say, \u201cWhat card was chosen? \n\n\nThe dealer will have to remember 3 simple patterns:\n1) suit - the first letter of the last word matches the first letter of the suit (Chose = Clubs)\n2) odd / even number - if the card is odd, the first word is \u201cwhat.\u201d If the card is even, the first word is \u201cwhich\u201d\n3) specific number - there\u2019s an alphabetic patter to determine the specific card\n- what / which (Ace / Two)\n- guess what / which (Three / Four)\n- let us know what / which (Five / Six)\n- reveal what / which (Seven / Eight)\n- say what / which (Nine / Ten)\n- tell us what / which (Jack / Queen)\n- can you tell us what / which (King / Joker)\n\nFull Key below\n------------------------------------\n\nNumber\n1/A.
