Just teach them to say, \"Alexa, open Story Starter\" then say \"Student,\" and Alexa will give them a daily writing prompt. Educational exercises initiated by students can help them become independent learners, while at the same time, developing confidence in their ability to finish assignments. \n\nAfter your child writes their response to the writing prompt, have them give it to you, and at your own leisure say, \"Alexa, open Story Starter.\" Choose the \"Teacher\" option, and Alexa will read the teacher's guide for the daily writing prompt so you can review your student's work. \n\nIf you have a pre-writer, have them dictate their answer to you, and use some or all of what you wrote down as an opportunity for them to do copy work. Dictation and copy work exercises will build reading, writing, and grammar skills.\n\nThis is the first Skill by selfStarter: VOICE EDUCATION.
