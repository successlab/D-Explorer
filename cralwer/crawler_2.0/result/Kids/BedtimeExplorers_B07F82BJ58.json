Say \u201cAlexa, ask Bedtime Explorers to set a bedtime reminder for 7pm\u201d.\n\nHello little explorer. Did you go an adventure today? Did you explore anything new? Did you have a lot of fun? Exploring takes lots of energy doesn\u2019t it? So when its time to slow down, settle down and snuggle down, it\u2019s time to become a Bedtime Explorer. \n\nBedtime Explorers are imaginative meditative journeys for children guided by mindfulness coach, Amy Taylor-Kabbaz, and calming sound design by Max Gosford. Each Bedtime Explorer episode invites children on an imaginative journey, teaching them easy-to-learn meditation techniques that they can use to fall asleep, or to just relax when the big things in life pile up on the little people we love.\n\nWe hope your little ones love listening to Bedtime Explorers. We hope you grown-ups love them too!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
