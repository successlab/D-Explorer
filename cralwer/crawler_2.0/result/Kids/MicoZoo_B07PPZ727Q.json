To keep her happy and make her happier, mommy started to build this more enhanced and customized skill - Mico Zoo. \"Mico\" indicates it's mainly for the tots, \"Zoo\" is for the content. But it could be for any one who wants to hear animal sounds! So far we support 79 animals (include dinasaur!) and 36 musical instruments. Just give it a try and let me know what you think!
