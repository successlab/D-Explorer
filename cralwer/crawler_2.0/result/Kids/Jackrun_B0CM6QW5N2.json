You will help Jack the turtle in this great adventure that will take you to visit the worlds of times tables. Every multiplication you get right will help Jack reach the finish line before Harry the hare. Winning Harry, Jack will explore the following levels and worlds. Do you want to help Jack?\n\nHow does it work?\nThe first time you play, Alexa explains the instructions. By default, we will create a player for you with the color \"green\".\nIn Jackrun there are eight worlds, corresponding to the numbers from 2 to 9.\nEach world has 5 levels with different multiplications, some easier and others more difficult.\nEach level has two phases: training and race.\n\nThe training will help you get used to the multiplications of that level:\n- Get all the multiplications right of the training and Jack will fill with energy its shell for the race.\n- If you fail, you will have to repeat the training to get all the energy Jack needs, but before that, you will repeat the failed multiplication three times.\n\nWhen you get to the race, you will have to answer the same multiplications as in training:\n- Get them all right, using your knowledge and Jack's energy to go to the next level, where you will find a new challenge with other multiplications.\n-If you fail, Jack will lose the energy, and you will have to start from the training.\n\nAnswer Alexa's questions to move forward.\nYou can also create another player or game profile by saying: \"new player\". There can be up to four different players. To change the player, say its color: \"change to red\".\n\nJackrun can be played with just your voice, or with visual support, offering a more complete experience on devices with a screen, such as the Echo Show or FireTV.\n\nAbout Jackrun \n\n- What does it mean to know the multiplication tables?\nKnowing the multiplication tables is being able to say the results without deducing them, without thinking, as a behavioral response to the stimulus of the operation.\n\n- Considerations about the traditional method\nThe traditional method consists of teaching the tables in an orderly way, after 5x6=30 perhaps the 5x7 is deduced from the 30+5, 35. In addition, the operations 8x2 and 8x5 (easy) and 8x7 are usually repeated the same times (difficult), which causes boredom and waste of time.\n\n- The success of Jackrun\u00ae:\n\nInstinctive and voluntary effort:\nIts success is due to the fact that the student\u00b4s memory effort is not forced but rather instinctive and voluntary, due to the psychological \"prize-punishment\" that she/he receives, depending on whether the kid succeeds or not with each multiplication.\n\nThe pace suits the student:\nIn addition, it is personalized: each student receives the \"punishment\" of having to repeat an operation only when she/he makes a mistake, which motivates her/him to learn it.\n\nGaming as a teaching resource:\nThrough the fable of the Hare and the Tortoise, the game becomes a didactic instrument that helps to make an active pedagogy as opposed to passive learning.\n\nAbout Multiplay and Much More\nWe are an EdTech that seeks through digitization to reach a broad audience, enabling them to learn learn in a fun way.\nWe have a unique teaching method.\nStudents who at an early age find it difficult or boring to learn are prone to \"having a mania for studies,\" and this can cause difficulties in their future learning.\nThose who learn with the Multiplay&M.M.\u00ae method tend to become fond of studying.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
