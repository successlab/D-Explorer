Kids can say, \"Alexa, open Call Santa Claus,\" and Alexa will connect them to Old St. Nick and all his friends at the North Pole.\n \nCallers can sing carols to help Santa\u2019s musical sleigh fly, laugh along with squabbling elves, and even build a snowman with Blitzen the reindeer. Created with Christmas cheer at the heart of every story, these festive adventures aim to have your family ho-ho-ho-ing along with Santa and his friends.\n \nHouseholds with Echo Show devices can also view Santa and company on video, where magical animation brings the winter wonderland to life.\n \nTroubleshooting: Some customers have reported Alexa calling a contact which includes \"Santa\" in the name, or reaching a different Santa voicemail skill instead of Amazon's Call Santa skill. If you experience either of these issues, try saying, \u201cAlexa, Open Call Santa Claus\u201d instead.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
