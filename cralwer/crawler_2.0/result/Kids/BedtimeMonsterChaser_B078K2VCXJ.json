Some live under rocks. Some behind waterfalls. Some even live in the sea, hidden behind shipwrecks. But everyone knows that most monsters live in children bedrooms!! \n\nSo we can get a good nights sleep, Alexa can help you check if there are any monsters in your room at bedtime. Or anytime!! Just say 'Alexa ask monster chaser to check for monsters' to check for the first ones. She'll let you know if she finds any then let you decide if you want it to stay or if she should chase it away. We don't need to chase them all away cause sometimes monsters are more scared of you than you are of them.\n\nNight night, sleep tight!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
