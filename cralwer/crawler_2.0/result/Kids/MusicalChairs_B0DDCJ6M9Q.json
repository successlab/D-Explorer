When the music starts, kids walk around the chairs. When the music stops, each player attempts to sit down in one of the chairs. The player who is left without a chair is eliminated from the game. One chair is then removed/eliminated to ensure that there will always be one fewer chair than there are players.\n\nAbout SayKid\nSayKid combines voice technology with tangible play to help kids learn in an actively-engaging way - without screens!
