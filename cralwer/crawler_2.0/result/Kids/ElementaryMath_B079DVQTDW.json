The skill will ask what kind of math should be practiced in a session. The choices are addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Once a choice is made, the skill generates 5 questions on that type of problem. Each response is marked correct or incorrect and instant feedback is given. The results of a session are stored so that the user is reminded what he or she worked on last time. To start the skill, or a new session, say \"Open Elementary Math\". After that, the skill will guide the user on what kind of math questions to practice. You can set the difficulty level to easy (default), medium, or hard.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
