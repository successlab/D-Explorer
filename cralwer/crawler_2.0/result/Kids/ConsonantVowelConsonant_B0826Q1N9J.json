Then they can probably start reading some three letter CVC (consonant vowel consonant) words some \"Letter Monsters\" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice. \n\nThis skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners gain fluency in reading words that have just three letters. There are many reasons this early skill is important to developing reading. There are about 200 CVC words you will want you early reader to know. They probably recognize some you didn't even know they were familiar with. Practicing is key and this skill is one of many tools you can use to keep the process of practicing rewarding and fun.\n\nToddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant. But there are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it. \nYou may want to try to the Long Vowel Monster and Short Vowel Monster Alexa skills if your child hasn't had much exposure to the concept of vowels and consonants.\n\nAs your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or \"sound out\" more difficult words will improve how fast they can read and how accurately they can read. This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older. \n\nBefore most little children can read they've heard \"Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times. Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful. We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child find another way to make word sandwiches (consonants are the bread and a vowel is the meat) fun.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
