Well, this is the educational game for you.\n\nOpen up your Alexa app or take a look at your Echo Show, because you'll need to see the wonderful animal pictures Alexa will send you. Once you see an animal you know, and Alexa asks what it is, just respond \"It's a fox!\" for example. If you don't know, just say \"I don't know,\" \"not sure,\" or something similar.\n\nThe more specific you are, the more points you'll receive! For example, \"red fox\" earns more points than \"fox\" for the red fox picture.\n\nPrepare yourself for a bonus round! You'll have to guess an animal based on only the sound it makes!\n\nHave fun, and learn a lot!\n\nNew animals will be added continually, so if you think you have all the current animals mastered, come back later!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
