Once you launch the skill, you can choose from two activities.\n\nMath Facts can be used to drill basic math operations, such as \"5 plus 6\" or \"4 times 8\". Just say, \"Play math facts,\" or \"Test addition facts up to five.\"\n\nOperations Challenge will test your concentration and math speed. You will start with a simple problem, such as \"5 minus 3,\" but each successive problem will add another operation. How far can your skills take you? Just say, \"Play the operations challenge,\" or \"Try the operations challenge with five operations\" to get started.\n\nIf you didn't hear a problem, just ask Alexa to repeat it.\n\nNOTE: For the Operations Challenge, all operations should be performed in the order in which they are spoken, so 5 - 2 * 3 should be calculated as 5 - 2 = 3, then 3 * 3 = 9.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
