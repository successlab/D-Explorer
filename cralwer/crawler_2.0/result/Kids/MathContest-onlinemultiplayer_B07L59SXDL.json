If you get the right answer quicker than others then you will get more points. The more players you beat, the more points you get.\n\n----- Echo Buttons ----\nYou can play as a team with Echo Buttons. If each team member has a button, they can use them to determine who gets to answer the question and avoid cluttering the voice input each round. Remember to wake up the buttons by pressing them once the skill starts.\n---------------------\n\nThe best time to play in is around 7pm US eastern time since players from both the West and East coast of the USA are active. It is not much fun playing by yourself, so tell your friends about this to ensure there are more players and points up for grabs. Playing on your lonesome will only get you one point per successful round.\n\nYour seven day total score is what determines your standing on the global leaderboard. So you don't need to win every round to be on top. Just play consistently well to stay on top.\n\nThe maths questions are moderate difficulty (e.g 4 x 22 or 144 / 2 ) so best suited for children between 7 to 13 years. Younger kids can join in by practising with a calculator.\n\nIf you have multiple devices around the house connected to the same Amazon account then the highest score will be taken for each round, so playing as a team can be beneficial.\n\nThis is one of the first realtime games on this platform so please provide feedback and suggestions to steven.bowden@protonmail.com\n\nPrivacy information\nOnly anonymous player scores are stored in the skill.
