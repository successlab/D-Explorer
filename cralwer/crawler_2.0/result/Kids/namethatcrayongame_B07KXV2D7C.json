It's even fun and entertaining to learn and discover names of crayons and challenge your friends. Guessing is allowed.\n\nHow did Crayola come up with these names? One of them was Macaroni and Cheese crayon, named by a pasta-loving 6-year-old. Another famous color was named by a 12-year-old Sam Marcus, who drew small facial expressions to correspond with each new crayon. His \u201claughter\u201d face was colored pink, hence Tickle Me Pink was born.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
