Then they can probably teach long vowels to some \"Letter Monsters\" in a matter of weeks with a little bit of practice. \n\nThis skill is designed give parents another way to help very young learners identify long vowels.\n\nToddler's and preschoolers that know their phonics can read simple three letter words without knowing how to tell the difference between a vowel and a consonant. \n\nSo why should your child get to know their vowels as soon as posible? There are many good reasons but perhaps simplest is that virtually every word used in English has a vowel in it. \n\nAs your young learner progresses in reading their ability to quickly decipher, or \"sound out\" more difficult words will improve how fast they can read and how accurately they can read. This impacts reading comprehension and as a result the ability of your child to teach themselves as they get a little older. \n\nBefore most little children can read they've heard \"Old McDonald had a farm, 'E', 'I', 'E', 'I', '0', many times. Simply knowing that E, I and O are vowels can be helpful. We hope this skill is also a helpful tool for you and your child find another way to make learning vowels fun.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
