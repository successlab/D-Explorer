If you get 5 good creatures into the Forest before the Witch you will beat her! \n\nOn each turn you will select who to send into the forest, the rules are simple:\n- Giants always defeat Elves since they are so much bigger and stronger.\n- Wizards always beat Giants by using magic on them.\n- Elves will always defeat a Wizard by tricking him. \n\nYou may also be joined by special characters from time to time! \n\nThe game is enhanced with images on devices with displays. Good luck, the fate of the Enchanted Forest is in your hands!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
