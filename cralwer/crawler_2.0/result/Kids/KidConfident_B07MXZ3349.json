The idea behind it is very powerful. Kids repeat 6 randomly chosen, positive affirmations about themselves. It takes about one minute to complete.\n\nPositive affirmations have an extraordinary effect on children - They help to inspire, motivate, and build confidence and self-esteem.\n\nWhen kids use positive affirmations from an early age they'll reap a lifetime of benefits.\n\nA really great way to start or end their day!\n\nThis skill never collects any personal data.\n\nIf you have suggestions to improve the skill, please let me know in the comments.\n\nThanks and have a great day!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
