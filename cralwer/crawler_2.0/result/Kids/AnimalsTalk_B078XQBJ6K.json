Does a dog bark or mew? Have you heard of the Lion bark?? These are few of the ways in which Alexa\u2019s new skill, \u201cAnimals Talk\u201d makes the kids learn about the animals in a fun way which not only imparts knowledge but also challenges them to think and analyze the questions. For example, instead of simply saying, \u201cThe Lion roars\u201d we have designed our skill to teach kids about animals by making them to think and rather teaches saying, \u201cHave you heard the lion bark??. If you did you probably mistook a dog for a lion. The lion roars and a dog barks\u2026.\u201d. This helps them to learn the differences and remember them more easily. Also y adding small stories they find it enjoyable to learn and remember it longer than the traditional methods. Kids have loved this skill and want more. So make sure you introduce this skill to your kids and enjoy seeing them immersed in this new world of animals.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
