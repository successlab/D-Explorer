A gentle alternative to time outs, Cool Down begins with a bit of encouragement and provides one to five minutes of audio to breathe deep, relax your brain, and calm down before going to back to work or play. Parents can use Cool Down to help members of their family to re-center instead of argue. Teachers can use Cool Down to separate students who need to spend a moment peacefully sitting in one spot before returning to classroom activities. Adults can use Cool Down for a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing before or after stressful situations. \n\nAudio selections include ambient sounds like birds or water and calming classical tunes.\n\nAttributions: \nhttps://freesound.org/people/tim.kahn/sounds/197714/\nhttps://freesound.org/people/3bagbrew/sounds/95753/\n\n\nA few things to get the most out of your Cool Down experience: \n\nRemember to be consistent. Cool Down is not a punishment, but can be an alternative to traditional time outs. \nShow affection to your child (and yourself!) both before and after Cool Down launches. \nProvide a spot to sit and reflect during the Cool Down process. Children often just need a moment to process their strong emotions.\nRemember to breathe! \n\nFor more ideas about how to use tech with kids in positive ways, see jentuttleparsons.com.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
