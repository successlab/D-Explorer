A monkey changing a light bulb in space? No problem! A vampire walking a tightrope with his eyes closed? Piece of cake!\n\nTo play the game, have Alexa open \"Who? What? How?\". You can ask for help at any time. Once a scene is selected, you can choose to \"skip\" it, or act it out. Fun background music will play for about 30 seconds followed by applause!\n\nGet your kids moving and using their imaginations with Who? What? How?", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
