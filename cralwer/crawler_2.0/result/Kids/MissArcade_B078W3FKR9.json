Meet Miss Arcade, your child\u2019s best friend that will teach them about self discipline and motivate them to do assigned tasks. Miss Arcade is an Alexa skill that targets children in elementary school (ages 6 - 10) with the goal of improving habits and introducing them to money management by earning stars and spending them on prizes. Both parents and their children interact with the skill.\n\nOur skill is based on an engaging task system that rewards good habits and promotes self-discipline. It is like an arcade game, but for completing real tasks and earning real-life rewards. Parents are able to set a number of tasks for their children, and specify how many \u201cstars\u201d they will receive on completion. Stars can be redeemed for prizes (like candy or TV time), which the parent also specifies with the Miss Arcade skill. When the child is done, they can report to their parent and the adult can mark the task as completed. Cheating will not be possible, as parents can check which tasks were completed recently and have the ability to reverse it. Both child and parent can ask Miss Arcade what the current star count is and what tasks there are left. This way, tasks can be self driven and done throughout the day, while homework can be done without a parent pestering the kid!\n\nBy using this skill, children are able to learn more about time management and the rewards of completing work in a timely manner. Additionally, they'll have to save their stars for more valuable prize, introducing financial skills. \nUnlike other Alexa skills or mobile apps, Miss Arcade is made specifically for kids and provides the type of fun experience that will help kids continue to engage with Alexa and establish strong foundations for time-management skills. \n\nProcess: \n- Add prizes (movies, video game time, etc.) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe how many stars it will take to redeem. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add reward. Quantities are not stored for prizes, though they can be removed at any time. \n- Add tasks (homework, housework) to Miss Arcade (parents) and describe what the task is and how many stars the child will earn after completing it. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to add task. Tasks can be duplicated and removed. \n- List tasks and rewards in Miss Arcade (child) and choose one task to work on. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list tasks. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade to list prizes.\n- The child completes the task and gets stars for rewards. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade that homework is now finished.\n- The child can redeem prizes with his or her stars. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to redeem prize. The parents will give the reward to the child.\n\nOther features:\n- Check how many stars the child has. Ex. Alexa, ask Miss Arcade how many stars I have.\n- Remove task in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to cancel homework.\n- Remove prize in the task list. Ex. Alexa, tell Miss Arcade to remove prize.\n- Check what the child has finished in the last 24 hours. Ex.
