Take to the stage and sing before a crowd of Frozen fans. You'll have two ways to sing: When you're in \"in rehearsal\", you'll be guided through a performance as you learn the words to a song and find your true royal voice. And when you're \"in the spotlight\", you'll sing on your own with the song's vocals set at a volume you prefer. So bring your microphone, your crown, and that awesome voice of yours and get ready to be the star you always knew you were. Frozen Sing includes the Disney Frozen song \"For the First Time in Forever\". More songs from Disney's Frozen and Disney's Frozen 2 are available in Frozen Sing through Amazon Kids+ subscriptions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Disney\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights - https://privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/your-california-privacy-rights/\n\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Policy: https://privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/for-parents/childrens-online-privacy-policy/\n\nDo Not Sell My Info: https://privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/dnsmi/", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
