Then this skill is for you!\n\nToddlers and preschoolers can do amazing things with numbers and letters, given the right incentives. Now you can measure their progress two numbers at a time, while helping them master adding and comparing numbers. If your toddler or preschooler can count to ten, this skill is for you.\n\nEvery child is unique, but they all have to learn some of the same things to succeed. \n\nNumber monster is a skill you can try yourself and, if it's something you think might fit with your child, you can personalize in the following ways:\n\n Choose an incentive (prize) for your child\n - One jelly bean\n - An apple\n - Using the iPad\n - A lollipop \n - Whatever else you want to offer!\n\nIf you got something useful out the Monster Four, tell us in the review comments and, if you want, let us know what you would like changed to better fit your child (number of questions, specific questions, prizes, etc.). We'll update the app for free and let you know when it's ready. It's that easy! \n\nHave fun and keep feeding those monsters correct number! Yum!", "priv": ""}
