A normal game sees how long you can go without reusing rhyming words, or saying a word that doesn't rhyme. A timed game sees how many you can rhyme in 60 seconds!\n\nIf you have fun make sure to leave a review! \n\nAnd if you need anymore help, say \"Alexa, ask rhyming game for help.\" If Alexa stops listening, say \"Alexa, ask rhyming game\", followed by your prompt.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
