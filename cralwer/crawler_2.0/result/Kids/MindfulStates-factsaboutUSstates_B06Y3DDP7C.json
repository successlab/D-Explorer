We started with the states and capitals to help her study for her 4th grade states & capitals quiz, and it was so much fun that we kept adding more facts!! She did all of the research, and she even wrote most of the code. We hope you have as much fun using it as we did creating it!\n\nHere are the types of facts you can ask about:\nState Capital\nState Flower\nState Motto\nState Bird\nState Grass\nState Rose\nState Rock\nState Nickname\nState Abbreviation\nCoordinates\nTimezone\nLatitude\nLongitude\nRegion\nPopulation\nGovernor\nLt. Governor\nWhat do you call someone from the state\nDate the state joined the union\nOrder in which the state was admitted\nTerritory the state originally belonged to\nWhat is next to the state\n--You can even say \"I'd like a random state fact\" and see what Alexa offers up!\n\nProvided by Mindful Gaming, Inc.
