It's a family friendly, fan created unofficial guide to Equestria and a trivia game, built for fans of the show of all ages. You can listen to some random facts about the show, or you can play a trivia game about it. Do you know all there is to know about Equestria? Play the game every day to see if you can answer the random sets of questions correctly.\n\nDesigned with 2 main parts and 1 surprise:\n \n*Equestria fact: Alexa randomly chooses a fact to tell. You can listen to just one, or as many as you like.\n\n*Equestria trivia game: A series of 3 random questions. The goal, get all 3 correct. If you get some wrong, there's a bonus question if you want it. You should be able to play every day and always get a different combination of questions.\n\n*The hidden surprise: This is my favorite part. Within each step, Alexa will ask if you want to continue. If you answer with something she won't recognize (you can say anything to trigger this hidden part, so go nuts,) Alexa will say randomly crazy Equestria related pony things in response, then she repeats her original question.\n\nTo start the skill, you can say:\n\n\"Alexa, open World of Equestria\"\n\"Alexa, start World of Equestria\"\n\"Alexa, launch World of Equestria\"\n\nPlease leave a 5-star review if you love this skill.
