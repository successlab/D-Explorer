For example, she may ask you \u201cWhat is ten times eight pineapples,\u201d or \"What is seven times twelve smelly socks.\" To score a point you would need to answer with \u201cEighty pineapples,\u201d or \"Eighty four smelly socks.\"\n\nAlexa is quite generous in her scoring. So if you get the answer right, but say the wrong silly object, she'll probably let you off! \n\nYou can ask Alexa to test you on any number, so it's fun for older kids and adults too. Why not try the 256 times table. \n\nOnce you have chosen your times table, by saying e.g. \"Test me on seven,\" Alexa will ask you 6 questions. After answering all the questions, she gives you a final score and tells you how long it took you to answer all the questions. \n\nSee if you can beat your friends and family by scoring full marks in the fastest time. \n\nBut most importantly... have fun!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
