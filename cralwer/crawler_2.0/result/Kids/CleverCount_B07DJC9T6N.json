Do you want to improve your spelling, but don't like those boring and badly working spelling skills? Then Clever Count is the right skill for you! Clever Count is not only the perfect skill for children, but also for adults who enjoy giving their brain a small exercise session. \n\nClever Count has been developed to train the brain in translating simple to complex words into characters and help to improve our spelling. \nAlexa will tell you a word and you will have to count the number of letters it has.\nIt contains around 9000 different words and allows you to vary between three difficulty levels, easy, medium and hard.\nThere are some special features included into this brain trainer, such as occasionally asking you to count the number of vowels in a word when you are playing on difficulty level hard. \n\nTo start training, you will need to enable access to Kid Skills in your Alexa app, as this game is for both children and adults. After that, just say \"Alexa, start clever count.\" to start a new training session. Alexa will then set the difficulty level according to your preferences and start asking you for the number of letters in different words, and all you have to do is respond with a number. It is as simple as that!\nIf you are done training, just simply say \"stop\" and Alexa will not only tell you the number of words, of which you counted the number of letters correctly in this practise session, but also the total number across all sessions. \nThis is all you need to know to start training your brain. Go ahead and try it out!\n\nA few helpful features you should know about:\nIf you need help at any point, just say \"help\" and Alexa will explain to you the game mechanics.\nIf you didn't properly understand the word Alexa said, just ask her to repeat it. \nIf you feel like changing the difficulty level, feel free to tell Alexa to change it for you.\nIf you want to delete your statistics and want a fresh start, just say \"delete my profile\" and Alexa will obey your command. \n\nBe sure to rate Clever Count and tell us if you enjoyed it!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
