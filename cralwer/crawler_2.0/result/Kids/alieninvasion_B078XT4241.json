Each of the games is targeted to teach and practice a different skill in an entertaining way to kids. \nFirst game, Teach-The-Word asks kids to teach new words to the alien visitors using word analogies. They get alien-coins in return for teaching them correct words and reinforcing their knowledge. Eg, Aliens know that \u201cCelsius\u201d is connected to \u201cTemperature\u201d by some relation (unit of measurement), kids have to guess what should \u201cMeter\u201d be related to so aliens can learn a new connection. Periodically, kids also reinforce their knowledge by correcting the sets aliens have made themselves based on previous sets.\nSecond game, Spaceships is about attacking alien ships with equations that equate to a number where the ship is located. Kids start with the \u201cweapon\u201d (aka mathematical operator) of addition and as they play more rounds, they unlock new weapons: subtraction, multiplication and division. Once they have more weapons available, they can decide which one they want to use for each attack. An example of an attack is: if Alexa says there is a spaceship at location 25, it can be destroyed by the kid saying \u201ctwenty plus five\u201d (since it equates to the correct location). \nAnd Finally, the third game I-Know-What-I-Know, Aliens try to engage kids in a trivia to test whether they \u201creally\u201d know the answers or if they\u2019re just guessing. Kids get more points answering honestly rather than guessing.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
