Kids get a chance to be a superhero by helping Hoggy on Missions to save Hoggyland from the evil 'Naruko'. Kids participate in highly engaging & interactive missions by being a part of the story and performing actions to move forward in the mission.\n\nAlongside fun &good habits, kids also get educational learning- For ex. when they unlock Magical doors by speaking the correct spelling of 'Ice-cream'.\n\nKeep your kids busy while you work & rest peacefully.\n\nHow to go on Missions-\n1. Start with 'Hoggy Missions'\n2. Follow instructions, try to perform actions as Hoggy tells, to move forward in Missions.\n\nHoggy Missions are Pretend Play, where the kid uses his/her imagination to imagine the world and uses relatable household objects to perform actions in the Mission- Like using a Pencil Eraser as Magic Stones for attacking evil Naruko with Magic, Climbing on the bed to avoid hot Molten Lava or hiding behind the curtains to hide from Naruko's bodyguards.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
