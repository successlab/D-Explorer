The intended audience is second to fourth grade students. While learning third-grade level vocabulary, speaker dialogue and being introduced to chapter books, the reader follows three main dog characters, one of which is blind, as they solve mysteries in an effort to assist others. The three dogs are different breeds and have diverse skill sets. The series incorporates many hidden lessons, including the value of individual strengths and differences; the importance of teamwork; and the reward of caring for each other and assisting others in a time of need. All profits from sales of the first book will be donated to PAWS New England to assist in rescuing the dogs residing at Tipton County Animal Shelter, a high-kill shelter located in Tipton, TN.\n\nFor more information on the DIG Series, visit the DIG website at digthebooks.com\n\nCredits:\nShara Puglisi Katsos (Author), John Bulens (Illustrator), Karen Talbot (Illustrator), Chris Plankey (Developer)", "priv": "Your requests to this skill are not shared with the skill developer."}
