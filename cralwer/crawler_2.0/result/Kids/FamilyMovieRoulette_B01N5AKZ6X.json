Tell Alexa your families favorite movies and have her pick at random one of those awesome movies you always want to watch again. \n\nIn my house, we had a candy jar filled with paper scraps with names of movies we love for us and the kids. On a movie night, one of my three kids would pick a movie title from the jar to watch. Of course, they would never agree, because Ryan chose or because Meg chose. Good news is we can let Alexa pick! Just start the skill and ask \"What movie should I watch?\". Problem solved since Alexa chose ! \n\nThe skill is fun and can be funny but most of all it stops your kids from bickering and allows you to enjoy a fun loving family movie night ! \n\nPsst, you can really use this skill for any movies you may want to watch just tell Alexa what to add and \"Family Movie Roulette\" will pick.", "priv": ""}
