You\u2019ll need to answer modulus questions to fuel your trip Home. When we divide two numbers, we get a quotient and a remainder. For example, 8 divided by 2 has a quotient of 4, and a remainder of 0. On the other hand, 13 divided by 4 has a quotient of 3 and a reminder of 1. The modulus is the remainder of dividing two integer numbers. You can use mod as a verb like divide or multiply. 8 modulus 2 is 0, and 13 modulus 4 is 1.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
