The skill simply suggests the games - it doesn't play the games, that's up to the kids themselves! We're going to add THOUSANDS of fun game ideas to the skill, so it never runs out. It was inspired by our own kids, who love making up games - about Kings and Queens, aliens, monsters, adventurers and so much more. We hope you have as much fun using it as we had making it!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
