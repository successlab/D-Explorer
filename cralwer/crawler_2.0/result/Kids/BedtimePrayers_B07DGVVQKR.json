Our prayers are all short and intended for children at bedtime. Alexa says the prayer slowly, so that children and their families can easily follow along and join in.\n\nBe sure to tell any babysitters about the skill too. It might help them keep children in their nighttime routine.\n\nAfter the first prayer, you can ask to repeat the same prayer, ask Alexa for another prayer, or just say goodnight.\n\nSome things you can say:\n\nTo start the skill:\n\n\"Alexa, open Bedtime Prayers.\"\n\"Alexa, launch Bedtime Prayers.\"\n\"Alexa, ask Bedtime Prayers to say a prayer.\"\n\nAfter hearing a prayer:\n\n\"Repeat the prayer.\"\n\"Say another prayer.\"\n\"Goodnight.\"\n\nParents can also say:\n\n\"Add my prayer\", to learn how to suggest your own prayer to add to the skill.\n\"I like this\", to hear how to send the skill's creator feedback.\n\nYou can also say \"Help\" for examples of things you can say to this skill.\n\nSome of our prayers are traditional, and some may be contributed by users of this skill. \n\nIf you have a favourite bedtime prayer that children in your family have enjoyed, why not send it to us and we may add it in a future update.\n\nPlease leave us a nice rating and a comment if you enjoy this simple skill. By the way, we'd love to add more prayers contributed by our faithful users. So if you'd like us to consider adding a family favourite of yours, just let us know by leaving a review in the Alexa app or skills store. Your contributions, ratings and reviews encourage us to keep improving this skill. Thanks!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
