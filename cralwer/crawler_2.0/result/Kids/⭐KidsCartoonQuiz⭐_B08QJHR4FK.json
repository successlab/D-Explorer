All you have to do is respond by choosing Answer 1, 2, 3 or 4. You can also say the actual answer, in which case Alexa will ask you to confirm your answer just to be sure she heard you correctly!\n\n\u2b50COMMANDS\u2b50\nThe following commands are available during the game:\n- WAIT, for Alexa to play you a music while you take time to think about the answer. To talk to Alexa before the end of the music, just say the name of the device, e.g. Alexa, Echo, or any other name you have set for your Alexa device.\n- REPEAT, to hear the question and choices of answer again. You can also ask Alexa to repeat only the question, or just the options.\n- HELP, to get a reminder on how the game is played, as well as the commands available.\n\n\u2b50NOTE TO PARENTS/CARERS\u2b50\nKids Cartoon Quiz was built specifically for children and as such, the content is adapted to a younger audience. For example, you won't find any question about who created a cartoon show, or the date it first aired on TV! The language and interaction was also kept as simple as possible so that children can play the game on their own.\n\nEnjoy!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
