Every question contains 4 words, and the child must pick out which word does not belong. An example question may be \"cat dog apple hippo\". In this question, \"apple\" does not belong because it is a food and the other words are animals. The goal of this game is to teach young children how to think quickly and associate similar words.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
