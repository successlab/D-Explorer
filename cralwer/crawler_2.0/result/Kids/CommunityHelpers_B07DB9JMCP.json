So, we decided to use their interest of engagement\nto our advantage (and theirs) by creating skills that will help them achieve their ABA and Social Skills\ngoals. And, if this can help our children, we're sure that it will help yours.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
