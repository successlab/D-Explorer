Children's singer Megan Schoenbohm sings one verse of the original Muffin Man song, and then four verses of a new version of it (written by Megan and Chatty Creations), the fun part is that you can choose who you're going to meet in the song!! For example, \"Do you want to meet a Dog or a Cat?\" then the song continues according to that choice! \n\nYou can always ask for your favorite character out of the 9 characters, for example, say \"Alexa a cat\".\n\nWe hope you have lots of fun!\n\nMusicTimeWithMegan.com\nChattyCreations.com\n\nBe sure to leave a review!
