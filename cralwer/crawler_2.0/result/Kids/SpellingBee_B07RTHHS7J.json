In Spelling Bee, words are kept at a Kindergarden/Beginner level to help growing and inquisitive minds practice and perfect spelling at its most basic level. Further, Spelling Bee helps nurture those minds to continue practicing, even as they may struggle to spell a certain word or answer a certain question. The goal of Spelling Bee is not to condemn failure, but instead use struggles as a spring board to master the topic. At any point you can say \"Alexa, review mode\" to switch to review or say \"Alexa, test mode\" to start a test. You can say \"Alexa, next\" to move to the next card.
