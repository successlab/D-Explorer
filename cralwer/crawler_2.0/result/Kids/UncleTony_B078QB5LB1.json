There is essentially only one interaction with this skill. The child provides a first name and is given an alliterative sentence using that name. I kept the skill very simple hoping young kids (5 - 8) would enjoy the silly, same-sound sentences and be able to use the skill without parental assistance..\n\nAlexa, ask Uncle Tony about \"Tina.\"\nTina, the tiny turtle, took time to teach Thomas, the two ton tortoise, to tap-dance, twist, and tango.\n\nThe user can also just Launch Uncle Tony and it will ask for a name. The user may also ask for the previous sentence to be repeated.There 3 to 4 different sentences associated with each letter. I hope to add more content soon.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
