Bamboo Math is divided into three learning modules \u2013 Number Sense (counting, place values, number patterns), Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division; word & number problems), and Measurement, Time, & Money (linear, volume, money, calendar, time). Learning modules are divided into units. Each round of math exercises includes problems from more than one module. Problems feature a fun mix of animals (e.g., tarantulas, octopuses, penguins, & more) and objects (flashlights, alarm clocks, umbrellas, & more). Children with a screen-based Alexa device (i.e., Echo Show, Fire TV, Fire tablet) see images that enhance the learning experience.\n---\nMULTI-USER SUPPORT: Families can set up accounts for up to 6 users, so each child can learn at their own pace.\n\nThe free version includes most of the basic and many of the grade level problems for each math learning module, for children in Kindergarten through 5th grade.
