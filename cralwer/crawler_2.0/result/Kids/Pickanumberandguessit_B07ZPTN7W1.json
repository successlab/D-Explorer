Specify your range and she shall give you a probability as a hint =]. Guess the number like \"maybe 69\" or \"I put my bet on 13\" and hope you got it correct. You can play this tiny game how much ever as you would like by simply invoking \"pick a number\". Please do make sure you give a small to big number range and use a keyword while predicting your guess ( this will be soon fixed in an update). A wrong guess will end the skill but you can say stop anytime to quit. Happy guessing !", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
