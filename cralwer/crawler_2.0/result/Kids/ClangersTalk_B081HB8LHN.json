Well now you can find out from the comfort of your own home!\n\nTiny and Small are waiting to talk to you, with Alexa on hand to get the conversation started.\n\nTiny & Small love to chat - find out about life on the Little Blue Planet, ask what they eat and what they do for fun... you can ask them anything you want and hear their charming whistle responses back.\n\nIf you are lucky you might bump into Major Clanger, Mother and Granny Clanger - and the Soup Dragon, Iron Chicken and Baby Soup Dragon are never far away. If you stick around long enough a Sky Moo might fly past and say hello!\n\nYou can also ask the Clangers to sing \u2018Happy Birthday to You\u2019 or \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to brighten up your day. With something for everyone, simply say \u2018Alexa, open Clangers Talk\u2019 to start talking to Tiny and Small.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
