Students using this MathHack are instructed to make a fist with one hand say the larger number, then begin counting up from their using their other hand to add the smaller number.\n\nThe system, using the Brainspray's Alexa lesson, has taken a child just shy of four years old from being able to add two digits to being able to accurately complete all 81 math facts within three weeks of starting the program. Your child may take less time or more time, but they will have a tool that goes beyond rote memorization in their box of solutions needed to master some basic math skills way above schedule.\n\nToddlers and preschoolers can do amazing things with numbers and letters, given the right incentives. Now you can measure their progress two numbers at a time, while helping them master adding and comparing numbers. If your toddler or preschooler can count to 25 and add one digit, this lesson is for you.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
