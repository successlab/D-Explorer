But there are a fair number of exceptions you should practice and this skill can help.\n\nThe e.a. vowel pattern is pronounced like the long e sound, a single vowel sound. This means it's technically a monophthong in lingual parlance. \n\nWhat? Well, don't worry, you don't need to know all of that to practice identifying words with the e.a. pattern that make the long e sound from words with the e.a. vowel partners that make a different sound, like the long a sound in break or the short e sound in bread. \n\nWe'll just call the ones that rhyme with \"eat\" eat words. Feed some baby monsters their eat words to practice. If you do well, reward yourself with an apple or a jelly bean.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
