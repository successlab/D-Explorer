Upon examination of the mysterious container and its contents, we believe we have come into possession of audio recordings from an expedition that successfully made contact with Santa\u2019s famous North Pole workshop.\n\nYes that\u2019s right. This isn\u2019t just some pretend fantastical audio tour! These are actual recordings of elves from the North Pole, assembling toys and flying reindeer. In addition, our researchers also believe there is a moment captured when you can actually hear Santa Claus himself - but only if you listen carefully.\n\nIf you enable our skill you will be able to listen to the following areas\u2026\n\n-Train Depot-\nLoud whistles in the distance, locomotives blasting in and out of the icy mist.\nEverywhere, elves creatures, scrambling, unloading barrels of nails, wood, and paint. \nWhere is it all going?\n\n-Toy Hall-\nA thunderous hallway filled with tiny creatures whirling about assembling toys.\nWho are they?\nRivers of trinkets, ornaments, nicknacks, games, dolls, cutting edge electronics fly into a great hall where miles and miles of brightly colored wapping paper spin together into presents, all flying to and fro. Whats that in the distance? A giant sleigh!\n\n-The Naughty or Nice Department-\nTiny creatures all around, hundreds of them writing names down on an enormous list. \nNice \u2026\nNice \u2026\nNice \u2026\nNaughty \u2026\nNice \u2026\nNice \u2026\nNaughty \u2026\nNice \u2026\nWho\u2019s naughty and who\u2019s nice?\n\nBONUS ACCESS\n\nWe at Trees With Leaves (developers of fine applications and other useful things) are proud to bring you these recordings in the form of Santa\u2019s Workshop, and would love it if you might consider purchasing some of our bonus access.
