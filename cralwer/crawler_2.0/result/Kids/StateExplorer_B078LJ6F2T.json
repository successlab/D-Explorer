Information Mode in which it gives them information about each of the states, and \n2. Challenge Mode in which it tests their knowledge by asking them a series of 5 questions on state capitals or nicknames. \n\nInformation Mode\nThe child can ask for information about a specific state, such as Virginia by saying, \u201cAlexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about Virginia.\u201d Or they can ask to hear about a random state by saying, \u201cAlexa, ask State Explorer to tell me about a state.\u201d Alexa will answer with the state\u2019s capital, nickname, motto, bird, and flower.\n\nChallenge Mode\nTo take either the State Capital or State Nickname Challenge, the child must first register their first name as a player. So, Bob would say, \u201cAlexa, register Bob.\u201d Alexa will use the name they give to track the points they earn during their challenges. A great feature is that State Explorer can keep track of multiple children as long as they use different names.\n\nOnce registered they can take a challenge by saying, \u201cAlexa ask State Explorer to challenge me on either State Capitals or State Nicknames.\u201d Alexa will then ask for their Player Name and the Difficulty Level for the questions. There are 5 multiple choice questions for each round. The Number of Possible Answers Given and the Points for a Correct Answer each depend on the Difficulty Level. This explains how that works:\n\nEasy \u2013 2 possible answers will be provided, and the correct answer is worth 1 point,\nMedium \u2013 3 possible answers will be provided and the correct one is worth 3 points,\nHard \u2013 4 possible answers and each one correct is worth 5 points.\n\nBecause Alexa will save the scores from their challenges, the child can find out his or her point totals by saying, \u201cAlexa, tell me my scores,\u201d and giving their Player Name when Alexa asks. Since State Explorer allows multiple players, kids can compare their scores as they increase their knowledge of the states.\n\nState Explorer is a fun way for children to learn some basic information about the states that will help them in school and probably even stump their parents!", "priv": ""}
