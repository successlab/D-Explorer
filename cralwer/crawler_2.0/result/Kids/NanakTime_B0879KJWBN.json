He composed many sublime poems through a lifetime of traveling the globe and sharing his enlightened message of Ek Onkar, Oneness. The Mool Mantar is said to be the first composition uttered by Guru Nanak Dev Ji upon enlightenment at the age of about 30. The word \"\"Mool\"\" means main or root and \"\"Mantar\"\" means chant or verse. Together the words \"\"Mool Mantar\"\" mean the \"\"Main chant\"\" or \"\"root verse\"\"\n\nThe Mool Mantar is regarded by many as the thesis of his work. Often described as just a summary of the Divine, the Mool Mantar is actually considered to define and carry a deep implication for human existence.\n\nEach of the 9 words (Gems) encompass a truly global concept of habits, traits and mindset we should aim to achieve.\n\nBy explaining the theories and suggesting practical ways to integrate each of the concepts into your daily life, Nanak Time intends to get you started on this journey of discovery and self-reflection.\n\nYou can pause and play by saying \"Alexa, pause\" and \"Alexa, resume.\" Just say \"Alexa, stop\" when you're done for the day.
