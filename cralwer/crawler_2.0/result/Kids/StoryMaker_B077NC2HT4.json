Alexa will ask you for 4-10 words and then use them to generate a fun story.\n\nThink fast and speak clearly! If you take too long or stutter Alexa might mishear you and include her own goofy word.\n\nUnlike Mad Libs and other traditional pen & paper games, Storymaker can remember your choices and use them multiple times in the same story. Plus, you can spend more time thinking about funny ideas and less fretting over articles and plurals - Storymaker will automatically make your word fit the story!\n\nWith new and original stories published all the time, Storymaker can provide hours of family fun while also teaching kids or English language learners parts of speech and helping their vocabulary grow.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for your feedback! We've added a bunch of new stories to play through and the skill now has over 30 fun stories! We'll be writing new ones every month too.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
