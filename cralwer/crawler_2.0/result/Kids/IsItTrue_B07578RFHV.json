You control the answer in the way you phrase your question.\n\nIf you ask a question in the form \"Is it true that...?\", the skill will respond saying that it is true. If, however, you ask a question in the form \"Is it really true that...?\", the skill will respond saying it is false. Other natural phrasings can work, but the presence of the word \"really\" will always be what makes the answer no instead of yes.\n\nFor your friends (or your children) who don't know the trick, this will seem like independent confirmation of your opinion.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
