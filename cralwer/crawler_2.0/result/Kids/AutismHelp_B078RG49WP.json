You will be offered skills to work on, with each step of that skill provided. You can work on multiple areas at a time, and Alexa will track your progress. \n\nThere's applause to reward children as they complete each step, and music to ease the stress of completing a step.\n\nWhy Autism Skills? I want to see children with autism grow and express their creativity and realize their dreams. I don't want the lack of verbal, functional or social skills to hold them back! A little every day makes a huge difference. Try Autism Skills...one skill at a time!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
