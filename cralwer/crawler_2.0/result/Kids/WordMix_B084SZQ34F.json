They will also enrich their vocabulary. Initially there are 8 categories:\n\n- Colors, Animals, Fruits, Cars, Clothes, States of USA, Months, or Actors\n\nAlexa will spell different words totally randomly depending on the category chosen. Once you get it right, you will automatically go to the next word. Very fun to play with family and friends.\n\nHow to play: Alexa open Word Mix and select \"Actors\"\n\n Alexa: Next Actor -> s,w,m,t,h,i,l,l,i\n You: Will Smith\n Alexa: Next Actor -> ...\n\n\n** NOTE: If you have an Echo, we recommend you take a piece of paper and a pen to write down the letters that Alexa will spell. In case you haven't had time to listen, say \"repeat\" and it will spell the word again.\n\nFEEDBACK\nPlease leave a review if you like the game.
