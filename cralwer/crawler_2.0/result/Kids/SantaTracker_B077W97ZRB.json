Then this skill is for you!

A highly talented team of informant elves lives with Santa at the North Pole and provides us the information. Ever since Santa went missing a few years ago, the elves have planted satellite GPS sensors in his Santa's clothes, on his sleigh, and in the reindeer collars to make sure that he doesn't get lost again. \n\nAt the North Pole, pretty much everyone but Santa knows that Santa is being tracked (even Mrs. Claus) but nobody tells him because they think it will make him nervous.\n\nIf you need more help, you can just say \"Alexa, Start Santa Tracker\" and the skill will guide you thru how to use the skill.\n\nImage derived from fotomelia free image catalog (images-gratuites-libres-de-droits-noel)\nCity/time zone information derived from worldtimezone site", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
