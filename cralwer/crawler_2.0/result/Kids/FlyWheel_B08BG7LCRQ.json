And we don't want to just \"teach\" you. We want to teach you in a way that helps you become an expert, and most importantly, have fun in the process.\n\nWe are starting with two topics: 'Math- Addition', 'Math-Subtraction', ideal for kids ages 4-12. \nFor our little friends to relax, we have also added a third topic, story time.\n\nThe teaching starts with Level 1 (single-digit numbers) and auto-upgrades the student to the next level if five consecutive responses are correct.\n\nThe skill will also keep track of where and how many mistakes you are making, and will take a few minutes to teach the user some helpful tricks.\n\nGive it a try! We would love to hear from you on how we did and what can we improve.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
