Topics and questions will be updated over time. The quiz is setup to provide a user with a random question after the user provides a category. After 10 questions are answered a final score is given. The goal is to try and improve every day, by trying Smart Kids on many categories over time. We will be loading new questions and new categories frequently, and eventually opening a leaderboard and targeted goals to further educational learning in a fun way. Other topics that we are considering in the future are Math, Science, Language Arts, and Current Events. Join the Smart Kids family, and together we can promote learning leveraging the fun of Alexa and voice-first experiences.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
