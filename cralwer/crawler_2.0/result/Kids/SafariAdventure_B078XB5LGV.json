From the time we are toddlers, many of us are taught basic animal sounds to help develop our memory and retention. This skill is the recreation and reimagination of the old-fashioned teaching methods. With Alexa, teaching kids about animals becomes much more interactive and fun. Safari Adventure has five different categories (Birds, Cats and Dogs, Farm Animals, Sea Creatures, and Grab bag for everything else) that are each split into four levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard, and expert). There are 100+ sounds to discover in total. This makes it so that whether a child or an adult starts playing, the challenge is adequate and the educational factor still remains. If you are a parent, feel free to play along with your child or children! Good luck out there!\n\nCredit for Skill icon: Free Vector Graphics by Vecteezy.com.\n\nThe sounds collected and used by this skill are protected by fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act since they are used in an educational context.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
