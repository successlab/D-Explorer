Then the boundaries are getting extended (counting to ten, twenty). Soon, the kids start changing the counting direction (counting backwards), or skipping numbers using a specific interval.\n\n\"Let's Count\" is an Alexa skill that will help children (and adults) practice their counting.\n\nThe user is supposed to define the upper and lower bound for the counting (these bounds are inclusive), the counting direction (forward or backwards) and the counting step (counting interval). The skill will do the rest.\nIn case of invalid parameters, the skill will notify the user that the counting is not possible.\n\nEnjoy counting with \"Let's Count\" Alexa skill.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
