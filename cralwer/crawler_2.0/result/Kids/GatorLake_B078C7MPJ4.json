Your goal is to rescue your keys from the lake and swim out without getting caught by an alligator. \n\nWhen you open the skill, you will be presented with a main menu. You can choose to play the game, view your item collection, view the high scores, or learn how to play. \n\nDuring the main game, you have a choice of three actions. You can either swim forward, dive down into the lake, or act like a wooden log. \n\nEach time you swim, it will take you one step closer to your car keys. When you dive under the water, you may find an item to add to your collection or you might find an underwater current to push you further to your keys. \n\nEvery time you swim or dive you there will be a chance that an alligator will show up near you. Until the alligator leaves, you are in danger. With each move you make, the alligator may come up and get you! The only way to protect yourself is to pretend to be a floating log. This will fool the alligator. \n\nYou win the game when you get back to shore with your keys. Each round you will be awarded points based on how many items you collected, how many gators you fooled, and and how many moves it took you to win the game. Good luck out there. You're going to need it.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
