There is a table with a random number of chips. Your objective is to not pick up the last chip. However, there's a catch! You and Alexa alternate turns, only being able to pick up 1, 2, or 3 chips per turn. The game is over when the loser picks up the final chip on the table.\n\nNow with 3 difficulty modes! Challenge Alexa on easy, medium, or hard. Easy and medium can be consistently beaten, but the AI on hard mode is much more clever. Will you be the first person to beat Alexa on hard difficulty?\n\nNote: To skip the welcome instructions in the skill, just interrupt by saying \"Alexa\", followed by the difficulty you would like to play.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
