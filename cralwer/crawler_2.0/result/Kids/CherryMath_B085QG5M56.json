Cherry Math keeps track of your answers, and will periodically ask you those that you missed. The difficulty is adapted automatically, while providing encouraging feedback as you progress. Cherry Math makes learning math efficient and stimulating.\n\nHere are some of the basic commands to get you started: \n\n\"five questions on additions\"\n\"four questions on subtractions\"\n\"nine questions on multiplications\" \n\"three questions on divisions\"\n\nOn multiplications and divisions, you can provide the tables as follows: \n\n\"1,2 and 3\" \n\"from 2 to 5\"\n\"all except 6 and 7\"\n\"from 1 to 3 and from 5 to 7\"\n\nSome of the interactions that Cherry Math will understand:\n\n\"Random order\" - questions to be asked randomly\n\"Ascending order\" - tables questions to be asked in ascending order\n\"Long answers\" - for a bit of cheering after each answer\n\"Short answers\" - for the pros and impatient ones\n\"Harder\" - make questions a bit harder \n\"Easier\" - make questions a bit easier\n\"Boring!\" - will stop current series and ask what do to \n\"Repeat\" - repeat last question\n\"Next\" - skip to next question\n\"Review\" or \"Practice\" - recently missed questions will be asked\n\"Revise subtractions\" - recently missed questions on subtractions will be asked\n\"Score\" - will tell your current score \n\"Close\" or \"Bye bye\" - Cherry Math will leave your place\n\nThe more Cherry Math gets to know you, the faster you will improve your math skills!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
