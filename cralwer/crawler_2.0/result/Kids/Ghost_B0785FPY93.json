Each fragment must be the beginning of a scrabble approved word, where only words longer than three letters count. The player who completes a word loses the round.\n\nStart a round by saying \"start\". Alexa will add letters to the word fragment, and you will have three seconds to respond. If you would like to hear the word fragment again, say \"repeat\". If you would like to add a letter, say \"my letter is\" then your letter.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
