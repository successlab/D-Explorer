It's created by Magoosh test prep, an online company dedicated to providing students with fun and helpful educational materials.\n\nJust ask, \"Alexa, play Spell the Word \", and she'll ask if you want to start the game. She'll give you a word and you will then spell the word together, alternating letters. For example, she might say something like this:\n\n\"The word is momentum. It means 'the force from moving'. The first letter is 'm'. What is the next letter?\"\n\nYou would then respond with 'o', and she would continue with 'm', and you would continue with 'e', and so on. Don't worry if you get a letter wrong! She'll ask you to repeat your answer in case she misheard you. If you get it wrong 3 times, Alexa will give you the correct letter and ask if you want to either start the word over or move on to a new word. That's it! Have fun!\n\nPlease leave any feedback in a review, constructive or positive, and we'll do our best to make this skill better for you!
