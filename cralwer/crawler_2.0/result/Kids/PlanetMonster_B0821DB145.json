Those number skills will help them to read and spell also. But when using numbers to describe letters, you are often more concern with the position (ordinal values) of the letter than cardinal values (quantity). You might ask your child, \"what's the first letter?\", or \"what's the second letter?\" \n\nIn these situations, the value of knowing 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so forth to reading efforts becomes clear.\n\nFortunately, there are many fun ways to get your young learner to voluntarily explore ordinal values while learning other important things about the world they live in. Learning about the planets is one way to do this.\n\nToddlers and preschoolers can do amazing things with numbers and letters, given the right incentives. Now you can measure their progress by adding numbers to five one at a a time by voice, while helping them master adding and comparing numbers. If your toddler or preschooler can count to ten, this skill is for you.\n\nEvery child is unique, but they all have to learn some of the same things to succeed. \n\nPlanet Monster is a skill you can try yourself and, if it's something you think might fit with your child, you can request to personalize in the following ways:\n\n Choose an incentive (prize) for your child\n - One jelly bean\n - An apple\n - Using the iPad\n - A lollipop \n - Whatever else you want to offer!\n\nIf you got something useful out the Planet Monster, tell us in the review comments and, if you want, let us know what you would like changed to better fit your child (number of questions, specific questions, prizes, etc.). We'll try to incorporate the personalization request into the app for free for the community and let you know when it's ready. It's that easy! \n\nHave fun and keep feeding those monsters planets! Yum!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
