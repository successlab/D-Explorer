It takes kids at this stage a lot of time and concentration to write each letter, so a standard spelling skill speaks the letters too fast for them. \n\nKid Spell can spell words one letter at a time, allowing the child to ask for the next letter (and repeat it), so that they can write them down at their own pace. The skill also displays a fun picture of each letter to Echo Show devices and to the Alexa companion app. This helps the child remember how to write each letter.\n\nKid Spell leverages the WebPurify Profanity Filter API to filter all word requests for profanity in order to avoid spelling inappropriate words for kids.\n\nKid Spell is simple to use. To get started say, \"Alexa, ask Kid Spell to spell dog.\" The skill will speak the first letter - D. To hear the next letter, say \"Alexa, ask Kid Spell for the next letter.\" Continue asking for the next letter until the end of the word. To repeat a letter, say, \"Alexa, ask Kid Spell to repeat.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
