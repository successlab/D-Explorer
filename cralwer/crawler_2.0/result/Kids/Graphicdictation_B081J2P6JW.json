There are several dictations in the skill, whose difficulty will increase as the user makes more dictations. Dictation speed can be changed (there are five speed levels, the game is default to the medium one).\n\nDictations are told trace by trace so the user can guess what they are drawing as the dictation goes on. Traces are referred to the cardinal points (north, south, east and west). This way, kids get used to managing with cardinal points. A piece of graph/plotting paper is needed to draw following the squares on the paper. If the user gets lost, they may say so and the dictation will start again from the beginning.\n\nHave fun drawing this dictations!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
