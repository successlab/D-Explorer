Play in \"Solo Mode\" with a single player, or if you have buttons go \"Head to Head\" with two player mode.\n\nListen carefully to each scenario, and see if you should throw a snowball. For example, if someone else is playing outside, you can throw at them, but don't go after the mailman or your mother with hot chocolate! Act quickly as you don't have much time and other players are throwing at you, so be quick with your selection.\n\nIf you have buttons, try the \"Head to head\" mode. The first player to hit the target scores a point, and Alexa tracks the score. Don't be too quick with your buttons, else you might end up getting knocked out of the game.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
