The answer was short so I decided to build a skill to give her response a little more. You will love seeing your child's eyes light up when talking to Alexa and building a friendship through asking and answering questions. You start up the skill by saying, \"Alexa open let's be friends\" or \"Alexa, let's be friends\".\n\nAlexa's questions and answers are randomized so you will never get the same exact conversation. This skill is perfect for children who need a little practice making friends and getting to know people and you can rest at ease knowing that no information is being collected.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
