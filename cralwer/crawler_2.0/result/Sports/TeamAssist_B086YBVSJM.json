In order to use Team Assist you must link your Amazon account to your TeamSnap account. You will be able to do this when installing the Team Assist skill in the Alexa app. \n\nAfter the accounts have been successfully linked, you can start interacting with Team Assist by saying, \"Alexa, open Team Assist.\" You can then interact with Team Assist using commands such as, \"When is my next event?\" or, \"List my teams\". Listing your teams will only list your active teams in TeamSnap. \n\nCurrently, the only two things you can ask Team Assist about a specific team is, \"What is the record for {team name}?\" or \"When is the {team name} next game (or event)?\" More commands will be coming in future releases, such as, \"What was the score of the {team name} last game?\"\n\nIf you have multiple teams that you are associated with you can ask Team Assist, \"When is my next event?\" or, \"When is my next game?\"\n\nYou will only be able to obtain information for active teams with which you are associated in TeamSnap. To get a listing of these teams, after opening Team Assist tell Alexa to, \"List my teams.\"", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
