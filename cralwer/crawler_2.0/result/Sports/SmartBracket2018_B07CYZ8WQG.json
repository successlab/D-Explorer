This application demonstrates all of the following:\n\n1. The artificial intelligence technology to compose and solve an extremely complicated sequential decision problem: how to choose every match in a 64-team single elimination tournament, when there are over a quintillion possibilities. The goal is to pick teams that increase your chances of winning a small pool of sports fans.\n2. The combination of this AI technology with the voice-enabled Alexa Platform.\n3. The plain fun of choosing sports teams in a tournament.\n\nSmartBracket(\u2122) uses Rapid Recursive(R) technology, pioneered by Supported Intelligence and now patented in two countries. This application works by capitalizing on opportunities that arise when teams are over- or undervalued by other sports fans, helping you to make selections that give your bracket a higher chance of success. In this voice-enabled edition, you just answer a few questions and the application does all the hard work for you. \n\nWe hope you like this demonstration, which is free. You may also like our SmartBracket.io application for the World Cup! And, if you are interested in the technology behind it, please check out the Supported Intelligence web site.\n\nNote: This Alexa Skill creates brackets for the 2018 tournament as if they were created by SmartBracket in early March 2018. You might know who won the tournament...but the application doesn't. This is intended to be be an entertaining demonstration. Don't worry, though, we will release a 2019 version next year!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
