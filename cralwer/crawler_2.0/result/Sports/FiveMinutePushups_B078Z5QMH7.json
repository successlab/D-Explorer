One session of Five Minute Pushups and you'll amazed by what's possible!\n\nFive Minute Pushups is a fun, difficult, and effective pushup workout designed to maximize returns. It's the most bang for your buck that you can get when it comes to working out. (FYI - It's actually a little closer to seven minutes, but it was important that we include all the movements we did, as well as leave some ample time for rest between sets!)\n\nDISCLAIMER: Five Minute Pushups is NOT an easy workout! That's because it produces results. You'll be coached through the exercises and encouraged along the way, but you've got to give it your all. If you haven't done pushups before it will seem HARD at first. Keep at it though and you'll be surprised with how fast you are improving!\n\nWe plan to expand and build many more workout skills for you to enjoy, so please let us know what you would like to see next. \n\nAny suggestions, questions, or bug reports are welcome at support@stokedskills.com. We'd love to hear all your feedback so we can continue to improve our skills. Enjoy!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
