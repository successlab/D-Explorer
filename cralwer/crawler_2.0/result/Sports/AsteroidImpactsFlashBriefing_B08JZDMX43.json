This skill contains: dynamic content.", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Get the latest impact predictions and Near Earth Objects\n\nThe briefing gives you:\n1. Any asteroid or comet impact predictions rated Level 1 or above on the Torino scale, which is a classification system for predicted impacts with Earth\n2. If there are none at Level 1 or above, the briefing will tell you the next Level 0 prediction. Level 0 predictions are not classified as hazards, as they have a probability close to zero or will burn up in the atmosphere if they do hit\n3. News about the next Near Earth Object flying past\n\nThe Torino scale is used to classify impact predictions, and goes from Level 0 to Level 10. Level 0 is not classified as a hazard due to the near-zero probability. Level 10 means a collision is certain, causing a global catastrophe and the end of civilisation as we know it.\n\nThe time zone of the Near Earth Object is stated as UTC in the briefing. This isn't strictly correct; it's actually TDB, dynamical time, which is a relativistic time scale. Assuming that you're an Earth-dweller, the difference is about 2 milliseconds.\n\nTranslations wanted - if you can help with a translation please contact ra_hardy@hotmail.com\n\nData supplied by NASA.", "priv": ""}
