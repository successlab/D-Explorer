Start by receiving the ball and your team - the Blackbears - are down, but have one more possession and looking to make a comeback.\n\nYou control the game by calling out plays - either running or passing. Just call them out by saying something like \"Pass Play Two\" and see if you can move the ball down the field and score! Say 'Customize Lineup' if you would like to set individual player names for the Blackbears.\n\nBlackbears Playbook\nRun Play 1 - Running Back Sweep\nRun Play 2 - Running Back Pitch Right\nRun Play 3 - Full Back Off Tackle\nRun Play 4 - Quarterback Keeper\n\nPass Play 1 - Running Back Outlet\nPass Play 2 - Tight End Out Pattern\nPass Play 3 - Wide Receiver Slant Pattern\nPass Play 4 - Wide Receiver Deep Fade\n\nIf you have Echo buttons, just set them up at the beginning, then use them to control the game.\n\nThis skill offers a premium version. With it, you can play additional game scenarios where the score changes and the ball starting point from the free version.\n\nTo hear the complete playbook, just say \"Read Playbook\". Here are some tips.\n- For running plays, the lower the number, the greater chance to break a big one.\n- For passing plays, the lower the number, the higher completion rate - but with a safe throw comes shorter yardage.\n\nAt any time, you can attempt a field goal, but watch out. The further away you are, the lower the likelihood that it will be successful.\n\nEnjoy the game!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
