Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.\n\nUsing the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy. \n\nHere are examples to try: \n \n\"Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday\"\n\"When is the best day to surf Lowers\"\n\"What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday\"\n\"What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor\"\n\"When is the best day to surf Pipeline\"\n\nFor surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:\nFor example, just say \"Sunset Beach\" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, \"Sunset Beach on Thursday\" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday. \n\nAlexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name. For example once you ask for a report like:\n\"What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier\"\n\nYou can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:\n\"What is the tide report\" or just \"tide report?\"\n\"When is the best day to surf\"\n\"What is the water temperature\" or just \"water temperature\"\n\nIf you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:\n\"Tide report for tomorrow\" or \"Tide report on Friday\"\n\nListed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available. There were too many to list here. The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com. New locations soon!!
