She then takes a brief pause before explaining what should be done in the given situation.\n\nAn example would be:\n - \"You are playing shortstop\"\n - \"There are runners on First and Third\"\n - \"There is one out\"\n - \"There is a hard-ground ball to Second Baseman\"\n - \"What is your play?\"\n - \"Your play is to hustle to Second Base to take the toss from Second Baseman for one out and then make quick throw to First Base to complete the double play!\"\n\nBaseball BASIQs contains over 7,000 situations to learn from!
