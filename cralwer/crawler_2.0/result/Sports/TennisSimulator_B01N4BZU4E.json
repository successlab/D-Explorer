It will then take those two players and simulate a match, giving you the final score result.\n\nYou can use this to run your own fictional tournament draws or look at upcoming matches and see who might win. It should not be considered an accurate predictor for gambling purposes.\n\nNote that although the simulation algorithm is still in development, it is based on the player's overall performance in the last 12 months. It is not totally random.\n\nYou may match up men vs. women but the simulator is not intended to be used this way.\n\nMake sure you use the player's first and last name. If you have trouble with Alexa recognizing a name, try pronouncing it phonetically.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
