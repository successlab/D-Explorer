Trinity Music is here to help. Built by music enthusiasts, Trinity Music was designed to simplify the process of finding new music. This is how it works (it's simple, we promise):\n\nSay you are watching a movie or show and hear a song you love, but don't know the name of it. You want to go grab your phone and try to find it, but you don't want to distract yourself from the scene or rewind the episode to find a good part to try searching. \n\nWith Trinity Music, there is no need to get up from your seat or rewind anything. Simply give the skill the details of what you are watching, and it will provide you with a complete list of songs and artists in your Alexa App, as well as the poster for instant reminders of your past searches.\n\n\n--DEV SUPPORT--\nThis was conceptualized and developed by three Computer Science Students at Purdue University. While studies come first, we are dedicated to improving Trinity to the best of our ability.\n\nPlease contact trinitymusicdev@gmail.com if you have any issues and we will do our best to get back to you as soon as possible.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
