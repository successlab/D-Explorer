Try this one. \n\n - Spain, Japan, Argentina, Bolivia\n - Which word doesn't belong? \n - Japan, because all other countries in the list are Spanish-speaking\n \nAnd things only get trickier from there! \n\nStart with the \"rhymes\" or \"mixer\" pack until you get the hang of things. Then move on to more challenging packs, like \"places\" and \"animals,\" and show Alexa what you're really made of! \n\nThe game can be played by both adults and children.\n\nJust say \"Alexa, start the Outlier Game\". Good luck!", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
