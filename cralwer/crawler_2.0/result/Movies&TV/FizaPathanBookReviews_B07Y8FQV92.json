Gabriele Amorth Book Review By Fiza Pathan The correct title of this serious and profound book is \u2018An Exorcist Explains the Demonic: The Antics of Satan and His Army of Fallen Angels\u2019 by late Fr. Gabriele Amorth, edited by Stefano Stimamiglio and translated into English by Charlotte J. Fasi. I, as an existentialist Catholic, was greatly moved by this book which I finished in a matter of a few days because of mainly one thing: the authors absolutely humility. I have read a lot of books about the Christian faith, but this was the first time I came across a \u2018non braggart\u2019 book which touched my soul and therefore I\u2019m reviewing it here in the form of a blog post on insaneowl.com. To all the Catholics out there, I advise you to pick up this book and follow the invaluable words of experienced wisdom that Fr. Amorth has brought to our attention especially where demonic possession is concerned. I want to highlight here that this is not a \u2018thrilling read\u2019 or \u2018an entertaining read\u2019. It is spiritual literature which must be treated with the respect it deserves. So please don\u2019t read the book if you are looking for something in the line of \u2018horror\u2019 or \u2018terror\u2019. Now coming back to my book review. I have watched the film \u2018The Exorcist\u2019 as well as read the book by William Peter Blatty. I felt the book was scarier, WAY SCARIER than the film but that just could be me. I remember reading the book which I borrowed from the Victoria\u2019s Library (Mahim) in 2017. I read it every night after a day of teaching non-stop and writing in my office-cum-writing hut. The damn book creeped the hell out of me! Ever since then I\u2019ve been roaming around with a wooden cross in my bag whenever I go out to shop for books. That\u2019s the only time I go out! Otherwise for business purposes, people must come to my office-cum-writing hut to meet me, I don\u2019t go out \u2013 I should change my name one of these days to Bugenhaegen!!! (remember \u2018The Omen\u2019) Well, after I read the book, I was spooked. My family told me that it was just an exaggeration of the way a demon possesses a human being. In fact, everyone who came my way, even priest ratified their absolute belief in the fact that the book and film was way too exaggerated. Everyone \u2013 except Fr. Amorth. According to Fr. Amorth when he was asked his opinion on the film and book \u2018The Exorcist\u2019, he was the only one voice in Christendom to say that HE HAD SEEN WORSE!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
