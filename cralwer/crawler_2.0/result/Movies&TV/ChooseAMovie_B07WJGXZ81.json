You want to watch a movie but you\u2019re just not sure what to throw on. So you spend 45 minutes digging through Netflix, HBO, Hulu, and iTunes just to find something that might be good. By that time, you\u2019ve either given up and reverted back to The Office for the millionth time or you found something that\u2019s complete garbage.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Choose A Movie skill comes into help. Ask Alexa to suggest a film from a few different categories and she\u2019ll give you a random suggestion of a list containing over 100 different movies. All of these films either have high praises from critics, audiences or are films we personally recommend and enjoy.\n\nThis list is updated every month with new movies, and releases.
