Some years have many that are really good - and some years it would be hard to find any worth the time. We have selected on from each year starting in 1980 right up to 2019. Invoke the skill and give it a year - and it will tell you what our favorite for the year was - you may discover some that you have not watched at all - or remember one that you will love re-watching. Either way, we hope you will enjoy this little chat about the holidays and these special movies.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
