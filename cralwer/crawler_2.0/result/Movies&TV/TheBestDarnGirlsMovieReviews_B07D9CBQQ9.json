You can give reviews from movies \"In The Theater\", \"Made For TV\", \"Video On Demand\", or \"In Stores\". Each description will give a quick plot overview, a brief critique, and a rating out of 5 stars. \"In the Theater\" are movies currently being shown in movie theaters. \"Made For TV\" are movies airing only on TV (i.e. Hallmark, HBO, Lifetime, etc). \"Video On Demand\" is videos that premiere on Netflix or Prime Video. And \"In Stores\" is 'in theater movies' that received a score of 4 or more stars that are for sale in stores. And now, Alexa will put that movie in your cart upon request. Enjoy. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, email them to thebestdarngirls@gmail.com.\n\nThis skill uses Alexa Shopping to make purchases on Amazon.
