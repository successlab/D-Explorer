Or if there are issues on a specific bus route? With this skill, you can ask for up to date data on all lines within SEPTA's system. With this skill, you can ask for the status of elevators, bus detours, service advisories, and system status. To get started you need to ask Alexa to open Philly transit. From there you just need to ask something like: \"What elevators are out of order?\" or \"What's the status of the Market Frankford line? or \"What's the status of Route 15?\" Or \"Is route 3 detoured?\" or \"Are there any advisory messages for the Broad Street line?\"\n\nThis skill is using the SEPTA API to make all of these requests.
