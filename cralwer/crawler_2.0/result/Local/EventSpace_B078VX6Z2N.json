This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: event space", "reviewnum": " 0", "des": "Event Space, a premium event finder skill, which integrates seamlessly into your daily workflow to help you find interesting things happening around your city.\n\nFind events near you. Never miss a single gig, play or conference in your town. Powered by a backend system which features tens of thousands of events updated daily in hundreds of major cities worldwide, this skill provides the perfect opportunity to track events happening in your city or town and send more info about them to your Alexa app. \n\nThere are two ways you can use this skill. The conversational approach...\nJust say: \"Alexa, ask event space, what's going on in Dublin tomorrow\" \nor even simply,\n\"Alexa, open event space\"\nIn this approach, Alexa asks you to fulfil 4 different parameters to give you the most accurate result: Category, City, Date and Keywords\nAfter that, you can confirm if Alexa picked up what you said correctly or retry it again. After confirming, all available events are filtered and querried and presented to you and to your Alexa app, in pages of 5 results at a time.\n\nThe one-shot approach...\nIf you want to avoid the hassle of the previous approach and get your results quickly, just say:\n\"Alexa, open event space and find gigs for Lord Huron in Dublin\"\nor\n\"Alexa, ask event space when Coldplay is playing\"\nIn this approach, Alexa will not ask you any more information. All that you say is querried and presented to you immediately. Try to be as specific as possible to get the best match.\n\nThere are several categories that you can choose from, including:\n- Music\n- Film and theater\n- Comedy\n- Leaning and Education\n- Family and Kids\n- Food and Wine\n- Festivals and Concerts\n- Art shows and galleries\n- Clubs and societies\n- Politics\n- Science and Technology\n\nIf you like what you hear, please do take some time off to rate the skill. Your contribution goes a long way in helping me develop more apps in the future.
