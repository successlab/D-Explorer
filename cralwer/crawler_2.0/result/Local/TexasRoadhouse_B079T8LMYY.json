She\u2019ll let you know which stores are closest to you and once you choose a location, she\u2019ll ask a few questions, like how many are in your party and if you need a high chair. Please keep in mind, this is not a reservation, but a great way to reduce your wait at the restaurant during busy times.\n\nSo go ahead, ask Alexa to put you on the waitlist at Texas Roadhouse and soon you\u2019ll be enjoying our Hand-Cut Steaks, Fall-Off-The-Bone Ribs, Made-From-Scratch Sides, Fresh-Baked Bread and Legendary Margaritas!", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy"}
