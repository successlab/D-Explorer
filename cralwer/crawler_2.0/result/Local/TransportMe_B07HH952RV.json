Let TransportMe help you!\n\nTransportMe tells you the closest bike or scooter within a 1.25 mile radius of a given location. It will ask for a location to search in which can be an address or a partial address. You can search for bikes, scooters, bike stations, or a provider. It can also use your Alexa device's location by adding `near me` at the end of the command. It will notify you how far the vehicle is and will send a link of the location to your phone. If a station is searched, it will say the number of available vehicles.\n\nWe currently support Jump, Lime, Ofo, Spin, Pony, Byke, Mobike, Bird, Donkey, and Nextbike. \n\nCommands:\n\"find bikes\"\n\"find scooters\"\n\"find stations\"\n\"find providers\"\n\"find bikes near me\"\n\"find scooters near me\"\n\"find stations near me\"\n\"find providers near me\"\n\"help\"\n\"repeat\"\n\"find bikes in <address>\" \n\"find scooters in <address>\"\n\"find stations in <address>\", where <address> is the full or partial address.\n\n--- UPDATES ---\n\n[10/23/18]\nYou can now find bikes/scooters/stations with an address in one command!\nFor example, you can say:\n\"find bikes in <address>\" where <address> is the full or partial address. \n\n[10/29/18]\nWe have added support for UK!
