The station is saved, after than just ask for 'next train'. The skill uses the live arrivals feed from TfL and will read them out.\n\nFor example, you can ask for \"next train from Shadwell\". After that, just ask for the \"next train\" to get the Shadwell arrivals again.\n\nMore info about saved results:\n\u2022 The station you last asked for is saved\n\u2022 Ask for 'next train' and the saved information from the previous query is used\n\u2022 Ask to forget the station and the stored station will be cleared. Subsequent enquiries will then also ask for the station without saving it\n\u2022 Ask to reset the settings, and the original behaviour is restored\n\nNotes about the data used: The arrivals data is supplied by TfL Open Data: \"Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2016 and Geomni UK Map data \u00a9 and database rights 2019.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
