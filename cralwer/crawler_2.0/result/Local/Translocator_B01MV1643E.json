Just ask Alexa for the next bus time once you configure your stop!\n\nFor ease of use, the activation phrase for this skill is simply \"Ride Helper\". \n\n**Configuring your stop**\nWhen you first enable this skill, you will be asked to configure your location. To open the app, say, \"Alexa open Ride Helper\". When prompted to configure your location simply respond with your address. If there is more than one stop near you, you will be prompted with a list of stops, and you must choose your desired one by saying \"Option <option number>\". If you are unsure of the stop name you want, you can find it on the Transloc Rider iOS app.\n\nPlease note that we search a 0.25 mile radius around the address you provide, so if the stop is further than that, you may have to input the actual address of the stop.\n\nNote: We do NOT store your address in our databases, only the stop you have chosen.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nFound a bug?
