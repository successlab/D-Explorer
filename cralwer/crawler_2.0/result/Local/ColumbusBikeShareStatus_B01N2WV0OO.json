You can request the number of bikes, docks, or both from any specific station. Use the station name, such as \"High Street and Lincoln Street\" or \"City Hall\" to make the request. Station names are displayed at the stations themselves and on the CoGo website. The names are generally either the nearest cross-street or a nearby significant landmark. If you only remember one street name, you can say \"Alexa, ask Columbus bikeshare what stations are on third\" (or whatever the street is) for a list of all stations on that street.\n<br>\nTo easily check the status of stations you use every day, the Columbus Bikeshare skill will let Alexa remember an origin and destination address. If you choose to store an address, Alexa will be able to give you the number of bikes available at the station closest to your origin and the number of docks at the station closest to your destination. If there's not many left, it will also check the next nearest station.\n<br>\nAsk Alexa to remember a new address with \"Alexa, ask Columbus bikeshare to save an address\", or change an existing address with \"Alexa, ask Columbus bikeshare to change an address\". You can also refer to your origin address as \"home\", and your destination as \"work\" or \"school\".\n<br>\nOnce Alexa remembers your origin and destination addresses, all you need to do is to say \"Alexa, ask Columbus bikeshare to check my commute\", and you'll know if you need to use your backup station!\n<br>\nYou can always check what address(es) you have stored with, e.g., \"tell me which home address is saved\". Remove all stored addresses by saying \"remove my addresses\".\n<br>\nThis skill is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or affiliated with\nCoGo Bike Share.
