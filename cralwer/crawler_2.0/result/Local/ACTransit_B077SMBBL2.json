Keep in mind that some locations have more than one stop ID. For instance, at College Ave. at Parker St., stop 57774 has the 51B toward Berkeley Amtrak and stop 51582 has the 51B toward Rockridge BART.\n\nNEXT BUSES FROM A SPECIFIC STOP\nYou can ask something like \"what are the next buses at stop 5 5 5 5 9?\" to get the next few buses coming to Shattuck Ave. at Center St. (Berkeley BART).\n\nADD A SAVED STOP\nYou can say something like \"add stop 5 5 0 0 1 to my stops\" to add El Cerrito del Norte BART to your saved stops. You can add as many saved stops as you want.\n\nNEXT BUSES FROM SAVED STOPS\nYou can say something like \"when is the next 6 bus coming\" to get information about the next 6 buses coming to any of your saved stops.\n\nREMOVE A SAVED STOP\nYou can say something like \"delete 5 1 8 2 8 from my saved stops\" to remove 11th St. at Clay St. from your saved stops. \n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis skill is not built by or associated with AC Transit.
