Once you know your bus ID #, you can use the commands to ask alexa when the next available buses will be arriving. The skill will list the arrival times for all the buses at that particular bus stop.\n\nDisclaimer: I am in no way affiliated nor endorsed by the University of Maryland's Department of Transportation Services.
