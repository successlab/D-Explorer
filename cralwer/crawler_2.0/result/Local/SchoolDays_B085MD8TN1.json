The next time you launch the skill (Open school days), it jumps right to the next day off for your district.\nAfter hearing one event or holiday, you can say next or previous to cycle through all the events we have configured for that district.\n\nWe only have a few Ohio school districts configured for now, but we can add yours - just send the school district you'd like to alexa@mandato.com . If it can't find your district, it will let you know.
