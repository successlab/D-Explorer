Just make sure you provide the name of the establishment and the city it is located in when using ChowTime. For example, you can say \"Alexa, ask ChowTime if Olive Garden is open today in Milpitas\" or \"Alexa, ask ChowTime when Boiling Crab opens in Las Vegas.\" Depending on which phrasing you used, Alexa would then provide you with whether or not the restaurant is open or give you the restaurant's operating hours.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
