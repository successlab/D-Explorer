The station is saved, after than just ask for 'next tube'. The skill uses the live arrivals feed from TfL and will read them out.\n\nFor example, you can ask for \"next tube from Kensal Green\". After than, just ask for the \"next tube\" to get the Kensal Green results again.\n\nYou can also ask for the line and direction:\n\u2022 \"Ask L. U. Times for the next northbound Victoria line train at Oxford Circus\"\n\u2022 \"Ask L. U. Times next southbound train at Victoria\"\n\u2022 \"Ask L. U. Times next Central line tube from Bank\"\n\nMore info about saved results:\n\u2022 The station you last asked for is saved. If you also asked for a line and direction, they're saved as well\n\u2022 Ask for 'next tube' and the saved information from the previous query is used\n\u2022 Ask for a line and direction without a station, and the saved station is used. You can use this to override the saved line and direction\n\u2022 Ask to forget the station and the stored station will be cleared. Subsequent enquiries will then also ask for the station without saving it\n\u2022 Ask to reset the settings, and the original behaviour is restored\n\nKnown issues:\nThe result for Paddington are a bit strange. This is because of the way TfL stores the data at this station.\n\nNotes about the data used: The arrivals data is supplied by TfL Open Data: \"Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2016 and Geomni UK Map data \u00a9 and database rights 2019.\"", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
