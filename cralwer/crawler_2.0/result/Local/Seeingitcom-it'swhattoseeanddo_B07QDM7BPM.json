Please register on Seeingit.com, type a promotion statement on our Alexa form, and submit to publish your business promotion to the Amazon Alexa Digital Assistant. \n\nYour typed promotion statement is now converted and vocalized for Users to hear.\n\nIt starts from a invocation process. In our case, to launch Seeingit.com - it's what to see and do!, a User would say \"Alexa, ask what's happening for\"... and it works like this.\n\nIn this example, a Restaurant Business would like to promote a \"Dinner Special.\" Assuming they have already registered and created an account on Seeingit.com, they would login to their account Control Panel and click/tap on the button \"Publish to Amazon Alexa.\"\n\nA form is then presented.\nStep 1: Select your business Category (Restaurant = Food & Drink)\nStep 2: Select the Subcategory of the promotion. Examples: Dinner Specials, Lunch Specials, Vegetarian, Steakhouse. Select from a drop down list \"Dinner Special.\"\nStep 3: Type your promotion. For example:\n\"Thursday Slow Roasted Prime Rib night served with vegetable salad and choice of side dish. 10 ounce price $19.95\"\n\nA Consumer User asks:\nAlexa, ask what's happening for \"Dinner Specials\" Thursday in Tucson Arizona, for example.\n\nAnd Amazon Alexa vocalizes the final promotion, example below:\n\"Tucson Arizona McGraw's Cantina Thursday Slow Roasted Prime Rib night served with vegetable salad and choice of side dish. 10 ounce price $19.95 520-885-3088\"\n\nSeeingit.com automatically inputs: 1) City, State; 2) Business Name; 3) Address; and 4) Phone Number. All a Registered Business User has to do is type a properly crafted and responsive promotion according to the \"intent\" of a Consumer User. \n\nWe highly recommend Consumer Users become familiar with the Seeingit.com website, as it works in tandem with the Seeingit.com - it's what to see and do! Amazon Alexa Skill.\n\nOn our website, we identify a User's GeoLocation and route you to a Local Page with 12 (twelve) Categories, each having their own Subcategory list. These Subcategories are part on the Amazon Alexa intents requested by a Consumer User.\n\nIf a User vocalizes, Alexa, ask what's happening for \"Dinner Specials,\" \"Nightclubs,\" or \"Tour Operator,\" the complete Business listing is found under the Categories \"Food and Drink\" and \"Entertainment\" on the Seeingit.com website. For more information that accompanies the Business vocalized by our Amazon Alexa Skill such as Map Directions, Pictures, Video, and Coupons, a User can locate the Business listing under the Category \"Food and Drink\" Subcategory \"Dinner Specials\" and the Category \"Entertainment,\" and Subcategory \"Nightclubs,\" or \"Tour Operator.\"\n\nFor more information, go to Seeingit.com where we have created a Video Tutorial to instruct and help you with our Amazon Alexa Skill business promotion system.", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
