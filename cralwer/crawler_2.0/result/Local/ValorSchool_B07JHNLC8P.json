Valor Christian School International is focused on developing confident, creative, and wise Christ following leaders, courageous with innovation and 21st Century skills. At Valor we have saturated our academic plan with God\u2019s Word, current education research on global competencies, along with best practices in education to establish a signature pedagogy. Our educational missions focus connects students with their God given purpose as members of Christ\u2019s body, in order to fulfill the great commission. In order to take students from apathy to impact, and to become effective image bearers of Christ it is important to empower students with the knowledge and ability to become world changers. We must model and provide opportunities for our students to transition from simply being hearers of God\u2019s word, to being doers of God\u2019s word. We do this by improving their global competencies, aiding students in the understanding of society and culture at home and around the world. VCSI effectively integrates a biblical worldview to real-world critical-thinking and core academic skill sets.\n\nYou can find out more about Valor Christian School International at www.valorschool.org \n\nEngage the skill by saying:\n Alexa, Open Valor School\n\nOnce the skill is engaged, try the following commands:\n Update me with the Valor Times News\n How are the Sports teams doing\n What's for Lunch\n Tell me about Missions\n What's on the Calendar\n Read me a short devotion\n Help\n\n\n**For information about this Alexa skill, visit www.CreateMyVoice.com or send an email to Support@CreateMyVoice.com", "priv": "Developer Privacy Policy\nThe developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
