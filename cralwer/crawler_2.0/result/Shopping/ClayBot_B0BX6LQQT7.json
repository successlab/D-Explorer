The aim is to explore and test novel conversational questions in product recommendation processes.\n\nTo test this prototype skill say:\n\"Alexa, launch Clay Bot\" to get going;\n\"I will use it for drawing\" to find a computing product that may help you draw;\n\"Why\" to get sample reviews connected to this product relevant to your context of use;\n\"Next\" to get the next review;\n\"Do you have other options\" to get the next best recommended product;\n\"Thank you\" to close the conversation.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
