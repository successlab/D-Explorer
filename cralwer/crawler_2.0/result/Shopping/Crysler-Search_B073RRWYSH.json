Perform simple search queries such as \"Alexa, ask crysler search if they have any capacitors?\" or \"Alexa, ask crysler search to find resistors\" and you will receive a response such as \"I found 507 results that matched your search term resistors!\".\n\nThis skill was designed as a proof-of-concept effort to further enhance the capabilities of our website. Future iterations of skill sets are slated to include checking the status of an order, retrieving your order history and hopefully one day, placing complete orders.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
