This skill contains: dynamic content.\nInvocation Name: zen buggy", "reviewnum": " 4", "des": "The Zen Buggy skill allows users with an active account on zenbuggy.com to add items to their grocery list via voice control.\n\nWhat makes Zen Buggy different is that, as you are shopping, you can mark the aisle locations of the items on your list and then check them off as you add them to your cart. Then, the next time you add those items to your list, they will automatically show up on the correct aisle. Aso, items tagged by other shoppers at the same store will show up as well, but you can easily change the location(s) if items have moved, etc...\n\nZen Buggy also supports multiple stores, and you can easily move items between them. Items moved will always show up on the correct aisle, as long as they have previously been tagged by you or another shopper.\n\nPro tip: Use the word \"And\" between items to add multiple items to your list. Zen Buggy looks for that word and uses it to separate your sentence into distinct items. For instance, saying \"Add Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly\" would show up as two separate line items.
