Some of this waste may be attributed to confusion around the dates commonly printed on the foods we buy and throwing them out before necessary. According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Best By, Use By & Sell By dates do not refer to the safety of the food, but rather its flavor or quality. (See details below.) Food Manager refers to those dates as \u201cpackage dates.\u201d \n\nEach of us can take steps to reduce the waste and give more food to the hungry. Food Manager helps you take the first step. It enables you to: \n\n1. Save foods to your virtual Food Manager Pantry with package dates, specifying one of the three commonly used kinds - Best By, Use By, or Sell By. \n2. Find foods that are about to reach their package dates within any number of weeks you request so you can use or donate them, \n3. Find foods that have exceeded their package dates,\n4. Find a specific food,\n5. Remove a food that has been eaten,\n6. Empty your Food Manager Pantry of foods that are past their package dates, and\n7. Get a list of all the foods in your Food Manager Pantry.\n\nThese 7 features of Food Manager will enable you to more efficiently manage your foods so that you need to throw out less food and can donate more. With a little effort, it\u2019s a win-win!\n\nSee our demo video on YouTube at:\nhttps://youtu.be/rGUZLiPpD0s \n\nFrom the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (www.fsis.usda.gov):\n\u2022 A \"Best if Used By/Before\" indicates when a product will be of best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date. \n\u2022 A \"Sell-By\" date tells the store how long to display the product for sale for inventory management. It is not a safety date. \n\u2022 A \"Use-By\" date is the last date recommended for the use of the product while at peak quality. It is not a safety date except for when used on infant formula.", "priv": "The developer reported that this skill does not collect personal information."}
